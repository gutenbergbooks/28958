<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN MENARD HAS A LAZY DAY.</h3>
</div>
<p>Captain Daniel Menard leaned
against the parapet at the outer edge of
the citadel balcony. The sun was high, the
air clear and still. Beneath him, at the foot
of the cliff, nestled the Lower Town, a strip
of shops and houses, hemmed in by the palisades
and the lower battery. The St. Lawrence
flowed by, hardly stirred by the light
breeze. Out in the channel, beyond the merchantmen,
lay three ships of war, <i>Le Fourgon</i>,
<i>Le Profond</i>, and <i>La Perle</i>, each with a cluster
of supply boats at her side; and the stir and
rattle of tackle and chain coming faintly over
the water from <i>Le Fourgon</i> told that she would
sail for France on the morrow, if God should
choose to send the wind.</p>
<p>Looking almost straight down, Menard could
see the long flight of steps that climbed from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
the settlement on the water front to the nobler
city on the heights. Halfway down the steps
was a double file of Indians, chained two and
two, and guarded by a dozen regulars from his
own company. He watched them until they
reached the bottom and disappeared behind
the row of buildings that ended on the wharf
in Patron&#8217;s trading store. In a moment they
reappeared, and marched across the wharf,
toward the two boats from <i>Le Fourgon</i> that
awaited them. Even from the height, Menard
could see that the soldiers had a stiff task to
control their prisoners. After one of the boats,
laden deep, had shoved off, there was a struggle,
and the crowd of idlers that had gathered
scattered suddenly. Two Indians had broken
away, and were running across the wharf, with
a little knot of soldiers close on their heels.
One of the soldiers, leaping forward, brought
the stock of his musket down on the head of
the nearer Indian. The fugitive went down,
dragging with him his companion, who tugged
desperately at the chain. A soldier drew his
knife, and cut off the dead Indian&#8217;s arm close
to the iron wristlet, breaking the bone with
his foot. Then they led back the captive and
tumbled him into the boat, with the hand of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
his comrade dangling at the end of the chain.
The incident had excited the soldiers, and they
kicked and pounded the prisoners. A crowd
gathered about the body on the wharf, the
bolder ones snatching at his beads and wampum
belt.</p>
<p>Menard raised his eyes to the lands across
the river and to the white cloud-puffs above.
After months of camp and canoe, sleeping in
snow and rain, and by day paddling, poling,
and wading,&ndash;&ndash;never a new face among the
grumbling soldiers or the stolid prisoners,&ndash;&ndash;after
this, Quebec stood for luxury and the
pleasant demoralization of good living. He
liked the noise of passing feet, the hail of goodwill
from door to door, the plodding shopkeepers
and artisans, the comfortable priests in
brown and gray.</p>
<p>The sound of oars brought his eyes again
to the river. The two boats with their loads
of redskins were passing the merchantmen that
lay between the men-of-war and the city. On
the wharf, awaiting a second trip, was a huddled
group of prisoners. Menard&#8217;s face clouded as
he watched them. Men of his experience were
wondering what effect this new plan of the
Governor&#8217;s would have upon the Iroquois.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
Capturing a hunting party by treachery and
shipping them off to the King&#8217;s galleys was a
bold stroke,&ndash;&ndash;too bold, perhaps. Governor
Frontenac would never have done this; he
knew the Iroquois temper too well. Governor
la Barre, for all his bluster, would not have
dared. It was certain that this new governor,
Denonville, was not a coward; but as Menard
reflected, going back over his own fifteen years
of frontier life, he knew that this policy of
brute force would be sorely tested by the tact
and intrigue of the Five Nations. His own
part in the capture little disturbed him. He
had obeyed orders. He had brought the band
to the citadel at Quebec without losing a man
(saving the poor devil who had strangled himself
with his own thongs at La Gallette).</p>
<p>To such men as Menard, whose lives were
woven closely into the fabric of New France,
the present condition was clear. Many an
evening he had spent with Major d&#8217;Orvilliers,
at Fort Frontenac, in talking over the recent
years of history into which their two names
and their two lives had gone so deeply. Until
his recall to France in 1682, Governor Frontenac
had been for ten years building up in the
Iroquois heart a fear and awe of Onontio, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
Great Father, at Quebec. D&#8217;Orvilliers knew
that period the better, for Menard had not
come over (from the little town of his birth,
in Picardy) until Frontenac&#8217;s policy was well
established. But Menard had lived hard and
rapidly during his first years in the province,
and he was a stern-faced young soldier when
he stood on the wharf, hat in hand and sword
to chin, watching New France&#8217;s greatest governor
sitting erect in the boat that bore him
away from his own. Menard had been initiated
by a long captivity among the Onondagas, and
had won his first commission by gallant action
under the Governor&#8217;s eye.</p>
<p>In those days no insult went unpunished;
no tribe failed twice in its obligations. The
circle of French influence was firmly extended
around the haunts of the Iroquois in New York
and along the Ohio. From Frontenac, on Lake
Ontario, north to Hudson&#8217;s Bay, was French
land. To the westward, along the Ottawa
River, and skirting the north shore of Lake
Huron to Michillimackinac and Green Bay,
were the strong French allies, the Hurons,
Ottawas, Nipissings, Kiskagons, Sacs, Foxes,
and Mascoutins. Down at the lower end of
Lake Michigan, at the Chicagou and St. Joseph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
portages, were the Miamis; and farther still,
the Illinois, whom the Sieur de la Salle and
Henri de Tonty had drawn close under the
arm of New France.</p>
<p>This chain of allies, with Du Luth&#8217;s fort at
Detroit and a partial control over Niagara, had
given New France nearly all the fur trade of the
Great Lakes. The English Governor Dongan,
of New York, dared not to fight openly for it,
but he armed the Iroquois and set them against
the French. Menard had laughed when the
word came, in 1684, from Father de Lamberville,
whose influence worked so far toward
keeping the Iroquois quiet, that Dongan had
pompously set up the arms of his king in each
Iroquois village, even dating them back a year
to make his claim the more secure. Every old
soldier knew that more than decrees and coats
of arms were needed to win the Five Nations.</p>
<p>When La Barre succeeded Frontenac, lacking
the tact and firmness which had established
Frontenac&#8217;s name among foes and allies alike,
he fell back upon bluster (to say nothing of the
common talk in Quebec that he had set out to
build up his private fortune by the fur trade).
Learning that, by his grant of Fort Frontenac,
La Salle was entitled to a third of the trade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
that passed through it, he seized the fort. He
weakened La Salle&#8217;s communications so greatly
that La Salle and Tonty could not make good
their promises of French protection to the Illinois.
This made it possible for the Iroquois,
unhindered, to lay waste the Illinois country.
By equally shortsighted methods, La Barre so
weakened the ties that bound the northern
allies, and so increased the arrogance of the
Iroquois, that when Governor Denonville took
up the task, most of the allies, always looking
to the stronger party, were on the point of
going over to the Iroquois. This would give
the fur trade to the English, and ruin New
France. Governor Dongan seized the moment
to promise better bargains for the peltry than
the French could offer. It remained for the
new governor to make a demonstration which
would establish firmly the drooping prestige of
New France.</p>
<p>Now the spring of 1687 was just ending.
Since February it had been spread abroad,
from the gulf seignories to Fort Frontenac,
that preparations were making for a great
campaign against the Iroquois. Champigny,
the new Intendant, had scoured the country for
supplies, and now was building bateaux and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
buying canoes. Regulars and militia were
drilling into the semblance of an army, and
palisades and defences were everywhere built
or strengthened, that the home guard might keep
the province secure during the long absence of
the troops. Menard wondered, as he snapped
bits of stone off the parapet, and watched the
last boatload of galley slaves embarking at the
wharf, whether the Governor&#8217;s plans would carry.
He would undoubtedly act with precision, he
would follow every detail of campaigning to the
delight of the tacticians, he would make a great
splash,&ndash;&ndash;and then? How about the wily chiefs
of the Senecas and Onondagas and Mohawks?
They had hoodwinked La Barre into signing
the meanest treaty that ever disgraced New
France. Would Denonville, too, blind himself
to the truth that shrewd minds may work behind
painted faces?</p>
<p>But above all else, Menard was a soldier.
He snapped another bit of stone, and gave up
the problem. He would fight at the Governor&#8217;s
orders, retreat at the Governor&#8217;s command,&ndash;&ndash;to
the Governor would belong the credit or the
blame. Of only one thing was he sure,&ndash;&ndash;his
own half hundred men should fight as they had
always fought, and should hold their posts to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
the end. There ended his responsibility. And
did not the good Fathers say that God was
watching over New France?</p>
<p>Meantime the breath of summer was in the
air. The spring campaign was over for Menard.
So he rested both elbows on the parapet, and
wondered how long the leaves had been out in
Picardy. Over beyond the ships and the river
were waves of the newest green, instead of the
deep, rich colour and the bloom of full life he
had left behind at Fort Frontenac but two
weeks back. The long journey down the St.
Lawrence had seemed almost a descent into
winter. On the way to Quebec every day and
every league had brought fewer blossoms. Even
Montreal, sixty leagues to the south, had her
summer before Quebec.</p>
<p>On the wharf below him the crowd were still
plucking the dead Indian. Menard could hear
their laughter and shouts. Their figures were
small in the distance, their actions grotesque.
One man was dancing, brandishing some part
of the Indian&#8217;s costume. Menard could not
distinguish the object in his hand. A priest
crossed the wharf and elbowed into the crowd.
For the moment he was lost in the rabble, but
shortly the shouting quieted and the lightheaded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
fellows crowded into a close group.
Probably the priest was addressing them. Soon
the fringe of the crowd thinned, then the others
walked quietly away. When at last the priest
was left alone by the mutilated Indian, he knelt,
and for a space was motionless.</p>
<p>The idleness of reaction was on Menard.
He leaned on the parapet, hardly stirring, while
the priest went on his way across the square
and began toiling up the steps. When he was
halfway up, Menard recognized him for Claude
de Casson, an old Jesuit of the Iroquois mission
at Sault St. Francis Xavier, near Montreal.
Menard strolled through the citadel to the
square, and, meeting the Father, walked with
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Father Claude, you are a long way
from your flock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Captain Menard, I came with the relations.
I have been&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Father Claude was
blown from his climb, and he paused, wiping
the sweat from his lean face&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I have been
grieved by a spectacle in the Lower Town.
Some wretches had killed an Onondaga with
the brutality of his own tribe, and were robbing
him. Are such acts permitted to-day in Quebec,
M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He was a prisoner escaping from the soldiers.
It must be a full year since I last saw
you, Father. I hope you bring a good record
to the College.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best since our founding, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there no word in the relations from the
New York missions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, M&#8217;sieu. Brother de Lamberville brings
glorious word from the Mohawks. Twenty-three
complete conversions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say he brings this word?&#8221; Menard&#8217;s
brows came together. &#8220;Then he has come up
to Montreal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true, then, that the Iroquois have word
of our plans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would seem so. He said that a war
party which started weeks ago for the Illinois
country had been recalled. A messenger was
sent out but a few days before he came away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;This word should go to the Commandant,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;How about your Indians at the Mission,
Father Claude? They have not French
hearts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but I am certain, M&#8217;sieu, they would
not break faith with us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can trust them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are Christians, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but they are Iroquois. Have none
of them gone away since this news reached
Quebec?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None, save one poor wretch whose drunkenness
long ago caused us to give up hope,
though I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What became of him? Where did he
go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wandered away in a drunken fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have not heard from him since?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu. He was Teganouan, an Onondaga.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would do well, Father, if I may suggest,
to take what news you may have to the Commandant.
You and I know the importance of
trifles at such a time as this. How long do
you remain in Quebec?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A few days only, unless there should be work
for me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you return then to Montreal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot say until I have made my report
and delivered the relations. Brother de Lamberville
thinks it important that word should go
to all those who are now labouring in the Iroquois
villages. If they remain after the campaign
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
is fairly started, their lives may be in
danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it necessary to go yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else, M&#8217;sieu? This is not the time
to trust too freely an Indian runner. And a
layman might never get through alive. My
habit would be the best safeguard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right. If I should not
see you again, I must ask you to convey my
respect to your colleagues at the Mission. I
shall probably be here until the campaign is
fairly started; perhaps longer. Already I am
tasting the luxury of idleness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A dangerous luxury, M&#8217;sieu. If I might
be permitted to advise&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Father,&ndash;&ndash;I know, I know. But
what is the use? You are a priest, I am a
soldier. Yours is penance, mine is fighting;
yours is praying, mine is singing,&ndash;&ndash;every man
to his own. And when you priests have got
your pagans converted, we soldiers will clean
up the mess with our muskets. And now,
Father, good day, and may God be with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest&#8217;s face was unmoved as he looked
after the retreating figure. He had watched
Menard grow from a roistering lieutenant into a
rigid captain, and he knew his temper too well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
to mind the flicks of banter. But before
the soldier had passed from earshot, he called
after him.</p>
<p>Menard turned back. &#8220;What now, good
Father? A mass for my soul, or a last absolution
before I plunge into my term of dissolute
idleness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither, my son,&#8221; replied the priest, smiling.
&#8220;Is any of your idleness to be shared with
another?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am bringing a picture to the College.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no money, Father. I should be a
sorry patron.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, M&#8217;sieu; it is not a patron I seek.
It is the advice of one who has seen and judged
the master work of Paris. The painting has
been shown to none as yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have seen it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I have seen it. Come with me,
M&#8217;sieu; it is at my room.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked together to the cell, six feet long
by five wide, where Father Claude slept when in
Quebec. It was bare of all save a hard cot. A
bale, packed in rough cloth and tied with rope,
lay on the bed. Father Claude opened the
bundle, while Menard leaned against the wall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
and drew out his few personal belongings and
his portable altar before he reached the flat,
square package at the bottom. There was a
touch of colour in his cheeks and a nervousness
in the movement of his hands as he untied the
flaxen strings, stripped off the cloth, and held
the picture up to Menard&#8217;s view.</p>
<p>It was a full-length portrait in oil of a young
Indian woman, holding a small cross in her
right hand, and gazing at it with bent head.
Her left hand was spread upon her breast. She
wore a calico chemise reaching below her knees,
and leggings, and moccasins. A heavy robe
was thrown over the top of her head, falling on
the sides and back to within a foot of the ground.
In the middle background was a stream, with
four Indians in a canoe. A tiny stone chapel
stood on the bank at the extreme right.</p>
<p>Father Claude&#8217;s hand trembled as he supported
the canvas upon the cot, and his eyes
wavered from Menard to the picture, and back
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not altogether completed,&#8221; he said,
nervously. &#8220;Of course the detail will be
worked out more fully, and the cross should
be given a warmer radiance. Perhaps a light
showing through the windows of the chapel&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked Menard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Catherine Outasoren, the Lily of the
Onondagas,&#8221; replied the priest; &#8220;the noblest
woman that ever rose from the depths of Indian
superstition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard&#8217;s eyes rested on an obscure signature
in a lower corner, &#8220;C. de C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly have reason to be proud of
the work. But may I ask about the perspective?
Should the maiden appear larger than
the chapel?&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest gazed at the painting with an
unsettled expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;perhaps you are right,
M&#8217;sieu. At any rate I will give the matter
thought and prayer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Indians,&#8221; Menard questioned, &#8220;in
the canoe; are they coming toward the chapel
or going away from it? It seems to me that
any doubt on that point should be removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the priest; &#8220;that very doubt is
allegorical. It typifies the workings of the
human mind when first confronted by the
truth. When the seeker first beholds the light,
as shown through the devotion of such a
woman as Catherine Outasoren, there arises
in his mind&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very true, very true! But I never yet have
seen a canoe-load of Indians in doubt whether
they were moving forward or backward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude held the canvas at arm&#8217;s length
and gazed long at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;do you
think it deserving of a place in the College?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see why not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think I would be justified in laying
a request before the Superior?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is your decision, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never can fully thank you, my son, for
your kindness in looking on my humble work.
I will not decide to-day. First I must add foliage
in the foreground. And I will give it my
earnest prayer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard said farewell and went out, leaving
the priest gazing at the picture. He strolled
back toward the citadel, stopping now and
then to greet an old friend or a chance acquaintance.
When he arrived at the headquarters
in the citadel he found Danton, a
brown-haired young lieutenant of engineers,
gazing at a heap of plans and other papers
on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Captain Menard,&#8221; was his greeting,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;d give half of last year&#8217;s pay, if I ever get it,
to feel as lazy as you look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are lazy enough,&#8221; growled Menard.</p>
<p>&#8220;That begs the question. It is not how lazy
a man is, but how lazy he gets a chance to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d been through what I have this
spring, you&#8217;d deserve a rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have had a stirring time,&#8221; said
the Lieutenant. &#8220;Major Provost has promised
to let me go out with the line when the campaign
starts. I&#8217;ve not had a brush since I
came over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard gave him a quizzical smile before he
replied, &#8220;You&#8217;ll get brushes enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, the Major wants to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he?&#8221; said Menard.</p>
<p>He lighted his short pipe with a coal from
the fire and walked out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE MAID.</h3>
</div>
<p>Menard did not go at once to see Major
Provost, the Commandant. He had already
handed in his report at the citadel. It
was probable that this was some new work for
him. He had just settled his mind to the prospect
of a rest, the first since that mad holiday,
seven years before, when word had come that
his lieutenant&#8217;s commission was on the way.
That was at Three Rivers. He wanted to idle,
to waste a few weeks for the sheer delight of
extravagance, but his blood did not flow more
quickly at the wish. He was an older man by
a score of years&ndash;&ndash;or was it only seven?</p>
<p>He lingered on the square. The black-eyed
children, mostly dirty and ragged (for the maids
whom the King had sent over by shiploads to
his colonists had not developed into the most
diligent and neat housewives) tumbled about
his feet. He allowed himself to be drawn into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
their play. They had no awe of his uniform,
for it was worn and frayed. He had not yet
taken the trouble to get out his fresher coat and
breeches and boots. He thought of this, and
was again amused. It was another sign of age.
The time had been when his first care after
arriving in Quebec was to don his rich house
uniform and polished scabbard, and step gaily
to the Major&#8217;s house to sun himself in the welcome
of the Major&#8217;s pretty wife, who had known
his uncle, the Sieur de Vauban, at La Rochelle.
Now he was back in Quebec from months on
the frontier, he was summoned to the Major&#8217;s
house, and yet he stayed and laughed at the
children. For the Major&#8217;s wife was older, too,
and the vivacity of her youth was thinning out
and uncovering the needle-like tongue beneath.
A slim little urchin was squirming between
his boots, with a pursuing rabble close behind,
and the Captain had to take hold of a young
tree to keep his feet. He turned and started in
pursuit of the children, but caught sight of
two Ursuline sisters entering the square, and
straightened himself. After all, a captain is a
captain, even though the intoxication of spring
be in him, and his heart struggling to clamber
back into the land of youth. He walked on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
across the square and down the street to the
Major&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>Major Provost welcomed Menard heartily,
and led him to his office. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have our
business first,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and get it done with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard settled back in the carved oak chair
which had for generations been a member of
the Major&#8217;s family. The light mood had left
him. Now he was the soldier, brusque in
manner, with lines about his mouth which, to
certain men, gave his face a hard expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;First let me ask you, Menard, what are
your plans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the present?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your personal affairs, I mean. Have you
any matters to hold your attention here for the
next few weeks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;</p>
<p>Major Provost fingered his quill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, of course, how your own
feelings stand, Menard. You&#8217;ve been worked
hard for three years, and I suppose you want
rest. But somebody must go to Fort Frontenac,
and the Governor thinks you are the
man.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>Menard made a gesture of impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a dozen men here with little
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. But this matter is of some
importance, and it may call for delicate work
before you are through with it. It isn&#8217;t much
in itself,&ndash;&ndash;merely to bear orders to d&#8217;Orvilliers,&ndash;&ndash;but
the Governor thinks that the right man
may be able to do strong work before the
campaign opens. You probably know that we
are to move against the Senecas alone, and
that we must treat with the other nations to
keep them from aiding the Senecas. No one
can say just how this can be done. Even
Father de Lamberville has come back, you
know, from the Mohawks; but the Governor
thinks that if we send a good man, he may be
able to see a way, once he gets on the ground,
and can advise with d&#8217;Orvilliers. Now, you
are a good man, Menard; and you can influence
the Indians if anyone can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a little vague, Major.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will go to Frontenac in advance of
the army to prepare the way. La Durantaye
and Du Luth are already at Detroit, awaiting
orders, with close to two hundred Frenchmen
and four hundred Indians. And Tonty should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
have joined them before now with several
hundred Illinois.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;ll bring many Illinois.
They must have known of the Iroquois war
party that started toward their villages. They
will stay to defend their own country. They
may not know that the Iroquois party was
recalled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Recalled?&#8221; said the Major.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Father de Casson has the news from
Father de Lamberville. You see what that
means. The Iroquois have been warned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid of it. These new governors,
Menard&ndash;&ndash;each has to learn his lesson from
the beginning of the book. Why will they
not take counsel from the men who know the
Indians? This campaign has been heralded as
broadly as a trading fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When should I start?&#8221; asked Menard, abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;At once&ndash;&ndash;within a few days.&#8221; Major
Provost looked at the other&#8217;s set face. &#8220;I am
sorry about this, Menard. But you understand,
I am sure. Perhaps I had better give you an
idea of our plans. You know, of course, that
we have three ships fitting out at Frontenac.
Already our force is being got together at St.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
Helen&#8217;s Island, by Montreal. Champigny is
engaging canoemen and working out a transport
and supply system between Montreal and
Frontenac. The force will proceed to Frontenac,
and embark from there in the ships,
bateaux, and canoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the rendezvous at Niagara?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, at La Famine, on the southern shore
of Lake Ontario.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard nodded. He knew the place; for
by nearly starving there, years before, with the
others of Governor la Barre&#8217;s ill-starred expedition,
he had contributed to giving the spot
a name.</p>
<p>&#8220;La Durantaye and Du Luth, with Tonty,
are to meet us there. You will instruct them
to move on to Niagara, and there await further
orders. We shall sail around the east end of
the lake and along the south shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Iroquois will follow your movements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We intend that they shall. They will not
know where our final landing place will be, and
will have to keep their forces well in hand.
And it will prevent them from uniting to attack
Niagara.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will leave a strong guard at La Famine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
with the stores, and strike inland for the Seneca
villages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now what part am I to play in this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Major Provost leaned back in his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Menard, are to represent the Governor.
You will move in advance of the troops.
At Frontenac it will be your duty to see first
that the way is clear to getting the two divisions
to the meeting place at La Famine, and to
see that d&#8217;Orvilliers has the fort ready for the
troops, with extra cabins and stockades. Then
the Governor wishes you and d&#8217;Orvilliers to go
over all the information the scouts bring in. If
you can decide upon any course which will hold
back the other tribes from aiding the Senecas,
act upon it at once, without orders. In other
words, you have full liberty to follow your judgment.
That ought to be responsibility enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard stretched his arms. &#8220;All right,
Major. But when my day comes to taste the
delights of Quebec, I hope I may not be too
old to enjoy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Governor honours you, Menard, with
this undertaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He honoured De S&eacute;vign&eacute; with a majority
and turned him loose in Quebec.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad, Menard, too bad,&#8221; the Major
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
laughed. &#8220;Now I, who ask nothing better than
a brisk campaign, must rot here in Quebec until
I die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you not to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I am to stay behind and brighten my
lonely moments drilling the rabble of a home
guard. Do you think you will need an escort?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the river from here to Frontenac is in
use every day. I shall want canoemen. Two
will be enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Let me know what supplies you
need. You mistake, man, in grumbling at the
work. You are building up a reputation that
never could live at short range. Stay away
long enough and you will be a more popular
man than the Governor. I envy you, on my
honour, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing more, Major. This galley affair;
what do you think of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the capture at Frontenac? You
should know better than I, Menard. You
brought the prisoners down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no doubt in my mind, Major, nor
in d&#8217;Orvilliers&#8217;s! We obeyed orders.&#8221; Menard
looked up expressively. &#8220;You know the Iroquois.
You know how they will take it. The
worst fault was La Grange&#8217;s. He captured the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
party&ndash;&ndash;and it was not a war party&ndash;&ndash;by deliberate
treachery. D&#8217;Orvilliers had intrusted to
him the Governor&#8217;s orders that Indians must be
got for the King&#8217;s galleys. As you know, d&#8217;Orvilliers
and I both protested. I did not bring
them here until the Governor commanded it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t help that now, Menard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not the question. You ask me to
keep the Onondagas out of this fight, after we
have taken a hundred of their warriors in this
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Menard; I know it. But the
Governor&#8217;s orders&ndash;&ndash;Well, I have nothing to
say. You can only do your best.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went to the reception room, where Madame
de Provost awaited them. Menard was
made to stay and dine, in order that Madame
could draw from him a long account of his
latest adventures on the frontier. Madame de
Provost, though she had lived a dozen years in
the province, had never been farther from Quebec
than the Seignory of the Marquis de St.
Denis, half a dozen leagues below the city.
The stories that came to her ears of massacres
and battles, of settlers butchered in the fields,
and of the dashing adventures of La Salle and
Du Luth, were to her no more than wild tales
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
from a far-away land. So she chattered through
the long dinner; and for the first time since he
had reached the city, Menard wished himself
back on Lake Ontario, where there were no
women.</p>
<p>Menard returned to the citadel early in the
evening. Lieutenant Danton was drawing
plans for a redoubt, but he leaned back as
Menard entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began to think you were not coming back,
Captain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m told the Major says
that you are the only man in New France who
could have got that trading agreement from the
Onondagas last year. How did you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does a man usually do what he is told
to do?&#8221; Menard sat on a corner of the long
table and looked lazily at the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t the kind of treaty our Governors
make; you know it wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not here under Frontenac.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I wish I had been. He must have
been a great orator. My father has told me
about the long council at Montreal. He said
that Frontenac out-talked the greatest of the
Mohawk orators. Did you learn it from him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy, when you are through with your
pretty pictures,&#8221; Menard motioned toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
plans, &#8220;and have got out into the real work;
when you&#8217;ve spent months in Iroquois lodges;
when you&#8217;ve been burned and shot and starved,&ndash;&ndash;then
it will be a pity if you haven&#8217;t learned
to be a soldier. What is this little thing you
are drawing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton flushed. &#8220;You may laugh at the
engineers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but where would King
Louis be now if&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, my boy, tut!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very well&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard laughed. &#8220;How old are you, Danton?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good. You have got on well. I dare
say you&#8217;ve learned a deal out of your books.
Now we have you out here in the provinces,
where the hard work is done. Well send you
back in a few years a real man. And then
you&#8217;ll step smartly among the pretty officers of
the King, and when one speaks of New France
you&#8217;ll lift your brows and say: &#8216;New France?
Ah, yes. That is in America. I was there
once. Rather a primitive life&ndash;&ndash;no court, no
army.&#8217; Ah, ha, my boy&ndash;&ndash;no, never mind.
Come up to my quarters and have a sip of real
old Burgundy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ever serious, Menard?&#8221; asked
Danton, sitting on the Captain&#8217;s cot and smacking
his lips over the liquor.</p>
<p>Menard smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I shall have to
play at composure for an hour,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
must see Father Claude. Settle yourself here,
if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard hurried away, for it was growing late.
He found the Jesuit meditating in his cell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Captain Menard, I am glad to see you
so soon again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard sat on the narrow bed and stretched
out his legs as far as he could in the cramped
space.</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon will your duties be over here,
Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to be no reason for me to stay.
I have delivered the relations, and no further
work has come to hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it may be that you can help me,
Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, my son, that I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I have been ordered to Fort
Frontenac in advance of the troops. I am to
bear orders to d&#8217;Orvilliers and to Du Luth and
La Durantaye. It is possible that there may
be some delicate work to be done among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
Indians. You know the Iroquois, Father, and
our two heads together should be stronger than
mine alone. I want you to go with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest&#8217;s eyes lighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that I can get permission at
Montreal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will go, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladly. It is to be no one else&ndash;&ndash;we
two&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have canoemen. To my mind,
the fewer the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, Captain, you cannot depend on the
canoemen. Would it not be well to have one
other man? You might need a messenger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard thought for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;True, Father. And if I am to have a man,
he had best be an officer; yes, a man who
could execute orders. I&#8217;ll take Danton. You
will be ready for a start, Father, probably
to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At any time, my son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was little work to be done in preparing
for the journey (Major Provost would attend to
the supplies and to engaging the canoemen),
and Menard still was in the lazy mood. He
stood for a while at the edge of the cliff and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
looked down at the wharf. It was dark, and he
could not see whether the body of the Indian
had been removed. The incident of the afternoon
had been gathering importance to his mind
the longer he thought of it. Five years earlier
Menard had been captured by the Onondagas
during a fight near Fort Frontenac. They
had taken him to one of their villages, south
of Lake Ontario, and for days had tortured
him and starved him. They had drawn out
cords from his arms and legs and thrust sticks
between them and the flesh. His back was
still covered with scars from the burning slivers
which they had stuck through the skin. They
had torn the nails from his left hand with their
teeth. Then Otreouati, the Big Throat, the
chief who had led his followers to believe in
Frontenac, came back from a parley with
another tribe, and taking a liking to the tall
young soldier who bore the torture without
flinching, he adopted him into his own family.
Menard had lived with the Indians, a captive
only in name, and had earned the name of the
Big Buffalo by his skill in the hunt. At last,
when they had released him, it was under a
compact of friendship, that had never since been
broken. It had stood many tests. Even during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
open campaigns they had singled him out
from the other Frenchmen as their brother.
He wondered whether they knew of his part in
stocking the King&#8217;s galleys. Probably they did.</p>
<p>It was late when Menard took a last sweeping
look at the river and walked up to the citadel.
His day of idleness was over. After all, it had
not been altogether a wasted day. But it was
the longest holiday he was likely to have for
months to come. Having made up his mind to
accept the facts, he stretched out on his bed and
went to sleep.</p>
<p>Danton took the news that he was to be a
member of the party with enthusiasm. Menard
had hardly finished telling him when he swept
the tiresome plans and specifications into a
heap at the end of the table, and rushed out
to get a musket (for a sword would have no
place in the work before them). The start was
to be made at noon, but Danton was on the
ground so early as almost to lower his dignity
in the eyes of the bronzed canoemen. He
wore his bravest uniform, with polished belt
and buttons and new lace at the neck. His
broad hat had a long curling feather. He
wore the new musket slung rakishly over his
shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>About the middle of the forenoon, as Menard
was looking over his orders, memorizing
them in case of accident to the papers, he
was found by Major Provost&#8217;s orderly, who
said that the Commandant wished to see him
at once.</p>
<p>The Major was busy with the engineers in
another room, but he left them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Menard,&#8221; he said abruptly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to ask
you to do me a favour. If I could see any way
out of it&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do anything I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I suppose you know the
Marquis de St. Denis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slightly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I shan&#8217;t take time to give you the whole
story. St. Denis has the seignory six leagues
to the east. You may know that he went
into debt to invest in La Salle&#8217;s colonizing
scheme in Louisiana. St. Denis was in France
at the time, and had great faith in La Salle.
Of course, now that La Salle has not been
heard from, and the debts are all past due
without even a rumour of success to make
them good&ndash;&ndash;you can imagine the rest. The
seignory has been seized. St. Denis has
nothing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Has he a family?&#8221; asked Menard.</p>
<p>&#8220;A daughter. His wife is dead. He came
here after you left last night, and again this
morning. We are old friends, and I have been
trying to help him. He is going to sail to-day
on <i>Le Fourgon</i> for Paris to see what he can
save from the wreck. My house is crowded
with the officers who are here planning the
campaign; but St. Denis has a cousin living at
Frontenac, Captain la Grange, and we&#8217;ve got
to get Valerie there somehow. Do you think
it will be safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hard trip, you know; but it&#8217;s safe
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t forget your kindness, Menard.
The girl is a spirited little thing, and she
takes it hard. Madame has set her heart on
getting her to La Grange. I don&#8217;t know all
the details myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can arrange it, Major. We
start in an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will be there. You are a splendid
fellow, Menard. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard&#8217;s face was less amiable once he was
away from the house. He knew from experience
the disagreeable task that lay before him.
But there was nothing to be said, so he went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
to his quarters and took a last look at the
orders. Then taking off his coat and his rough
shirt, he placed the papers carefully in a buckskin
bag, which he hung about his neck.</p>
<p>Everything was ready at the wharf. The
long canoe lay waiting, a <i>voyageur</i> at each
end. The bales were stowed carefully in the
centre. Father de Casson met Menard at the
upper end of the dock. He had come down
by way of the winding road, for his bundle was
heavy, and he knew no way but to carry it himself.
Menard good-naturedly gave him a hand
as they crossed the dock. When they had set
it down, and Menard straightened up, his eyes
twinkled, for young Danton, in his finery, was
nervously walking back and forth at the edge
of the dock, looking fixedly into the canoe,
apparently inspecting the bales. His shoulders
were unused to the musket, and by a quick
turn he had brought the muzzle under the rim
of his hat, setting it on the side of his head.
His face was red.</p>
<p>Sitting on a bundle, a rod away, was a girl,
perhaps eighteen or nineteen years old, wearing
a simple travelling dress. Her hands were
clasped tightly in her lap, and she gazed steadily
out over the water with an air that would
have been haughty save for the slight upward
tip of her nose.</p>

&#8220;Sitting on a bundle was, a girl, perhaps eighteen or nineteen years old.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>Menard&#8217;s eyes sobered, and he handed his
musket to one of the canoemen. Then he
crossed over to where the maiden was sitting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle St. Denis?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked up at him. Her eyes seemed
to take in the dinginess of his uniform. She
inclined her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Captain Menard. Major Provost tells
me that I am to have the honour of escorting
you to Fort Frontenac. With your permission
we will start. Father Claude de Casson is to
go with us, and Lieutenant Danton.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bundle was placed in the canoe. Menard
helped the girl to a seat near the middle:
from the way she stepped in and took her seat
he saw that she had been on the river before.
Danton, with his Parisian airs, had to be helped
in carefully. Then they were off, each of the
four men swinging a paddle, though Danton
managed his awkwardly at first.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>MADEMOISELLE EATS HER BREAKFAST.</h3>
</div>
<p>The sun hung low over the western woods
when Menard, at the close of the second
day, headed the canoe shoreward. The great
river swept by with hardly a surface motion,
dimpling and rippling under the last touch of
the day breeze. Menard&#8217;s eyes rested on
Father Claude, as the canoe drew into the
shadow of the trees. The priest, stiff from the
hours of sitting and kneeling, had taken up a
paddle and was handling it deftly. He had
rolled his sleeves up to the elbow, showing a
thin forearm with wire-like muscles. The two
<i>voyageurs</i>, at bow and stern, were proving to
be quiet enough fellows. Guerin, the younger,
wore a boyish, half-confiding look. His fellow,
Perrot, was an older man.</p>
<p>Menard felt, when he thought of Danton, a
sense of pride in his own right judgment.
The boy was taking hold with a strong, if unguided,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
hand. Already the feather was gone
from his hat, the lace from his throat. Two
days in the canoe and a night on the ground
had stained and wrinkled his uniform,&ndash;&ndash;a condition
of which, with his quick adaptability, he
was already beginning to feel proud. He had
flushed often, during the first day, under the
shrewd glances of the <i>voyageurs</i>, who read the
inexperience in his bright clothes and white
hands. Menard knew, from the way his shoulders
followed the swing of his arms, that the
steady paddling was laming him sadly. He
would allow Danton five days more; at the
week&#8217;s end he must be a man, else the experiment
had failed.</p>
<p>The canoe scraped bottom under a wild
growth of brush and outreaching trees. The
forest was stirring with the rustle and call of
birds, with the breath of the leaves and the
far-away crackle and plunge of larger animals
through the undergrowth. A chipmunk, with
inquisitive eyes, sat on the root of a knotted
oak, but he whisked away when Menard and
the canoemen stepped into the shallow water.
Overhead, showing little fear of the canoe
and of the strangely clad animals within it,
scampered a family of red squirrels, now nibbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
a nut from the winter&#8217;s store, now running
and jumping from tree to tree, until only
by the shaking of the twigs and the leaf-clusters
could one follow their movements.</p>
<p>The maid leaned an elbow on the bale which
Danton had placed at her back, and rested her
cheek on her hand. They were under the
drooping branches of an elm that stood holding
to the edge of the bank. Well out over
the water sat one of the squirrels, his tail
sweeping above his head, nibbling an acorn,
and looking with hasty little glances at the
canoe. She watched him, and memories came
into her eyes. There had been squirrels on
her father&#8217;s seignory who would take nuts
from her hand, burying them slyly under the
bushes, and hurrying back for more.</p>
<p>Danton came wading to the side of the
canoe to help her to the bank, but she took his
hand only to steady herself while rising. Stepping
over the bracing-strips between the gunwales,
she caught a swaying branch, and swung
herself lightly ashore. Back from the water
the ground rose into a low hill, covered with
oak and elm and ragged hickory trees. Here,
for a space, there was little undergrowth, and
save under the heaviest of the trees the ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
was green with short, coarse grass. Danton
took a hatchet from the canoe, and trimmed a
fir tree, heaping armfuls of green boughs at the
foot of an oak near the top of the slope. Over
these he threw a blanket. The maid came
slowly up the hill, in response to his call, and
with a weary little smile of thanks she sank
upon the fragrant couch. She rested against
the tree trunk, gazing through the nearer foliage
at the rushing river.</p>
<p>For the two days she had been like this,&ndash;&ndash;silent,
shy, with sad eyes. And Danton,&ndash;&ndash;who
could no more have avoided the company of
such a maid than he could have left off eating
or breathing or laughing,&ndash;&ndash;Danton, for all his
short Paris life (which should, Heaven knows,
have given him a front with the maids), could
do nothing but hang about, eager for a smile
or a word, yet too young to know that he could
better serve his case by leaving her with her
thoughts, and with the boundless woods and
the great lonely spaces of the river. Menard
saw the comedy&ndash;&ndash;as indeed, who of the
party did not&ndash;&ndash;and was amused. A few
moments later he glanced again toward the
oak. He was sharpening a knife, and could
seem not to be observing. Danton was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
sitting a few yards from the maid, with the
awkward air of a youth who doubts his welcome.
She still looked out over the water.
Menard saw that her face was white and drooping.
He knew that she had not slept; for
twice during the preceding night, as he lay in
his blanket, he had heard from under the overturned
canoe, where she lay, the low sound of
her sobbing.</p>
<p>Menard walked slowly down the slope, testing
the knife-edge with his thumb, his short
pipe between his teeth. He sheathed his knife,
lowered his pipe, and called:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guerin.&#8221; The two men, who were bringing
wood to the fire, looked up. &#8220;Where has the
Father gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Guerin pointed around the base of the hill.
&#8220;He went to the woods, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a bundle,&#8221; added Perrot.</p>
<p>Menard walked around the hill, and after a
little searching found the priest, kneeling, in a
clearing, before the portrait of Catharine Outasoren,
which he had set against a tree. His
brushes and paints were spread on the ground
before him. He did not hear Menard approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;you brought the
picture!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>The priest looked up over his shoulder, with
a startled manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I myself have stripped down to the lightest
necessaries,&#8221; said Menard, with a significant
glance at the portrait.</p>
<p>The priest lowered his brush, and sat looking
at the picture with troubled eyes. &#8220;I had no
place for it,&#8221; he said at last, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t take it at the College, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were very kind. They felt that
perhaps it was not entirely completed, and
that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will leave it at Montreal, then, at the
Mission?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&ndash;&ndash;I suppose so. Yes, I shall plan to
leave it there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard leaned against a tree, and pressed
the tobacco down in his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been doing some thinking in the
last few minutes, Father. I&#8217;ve decided to make
my first call on you for assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is about the maid. Have you noticed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems of a sober mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see why? It is her father&#8217;s
losses, and this journey. She is taking it very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
hard. She is afraid, Father, all the time; and
she neither sleeps nor eats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is naturally hard for such a child as she
is to take this journey. She has had no experience,&ndash;&ndash;she
does not comprehend the easy customs
and the hard travelling of the frontier. I
think that in time&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard was puffing impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do you remember when
Major Gordeau was killed, and I was detailed
to bring his wife and daughter down to Three
Rivers? It was much like this. They fretted
and could not sleep, and the coarse fare of the
road was beneath their appetites. Do you
remember? And when it came to taking the
rapids, with the same days of hard work that
lie before us now, they were too weak, and
they sickened, the mother first, then the daughter.
When I think of that, Father, of the last
week of that journey, and of how I swore
never again to take a woman in my care on the
river, I&ndash;&ndash;well, there is no use in going over
it. If this goes on, we shall not get to Frontenac
in time, that is all. And I cannot afford
to take such a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest looked grave. The long struggle
against the rapids from Montreal to La Gallette
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
had tried the hardihood of more than one strong
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is probable, my son, that the sense of
your responsibility makes you a little over-cautious.
She is a strong enough child, I
should say. Still, perhaps the food is not what
she has been accustomed to. I have noticed
that she eats little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perrot is too fond of grease,&#8221; Menard said.
&#8220;I must tell him to use less grease.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she should be taken sick, we could leave
her with someone at Montreal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave her at Montreal!&#8221; exclaimed Menard.
&#8220;When she breaks down, it will be in the
rapids. And then I must either go on alone,
or wait with you until she is strong enough to
be carried. In any case it means confusion
and delay. And I must not be delayed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you in mind to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must find a way to brighten her spirits.
It is homesickness that worries her, and sorrow
for her father, and dread of what is before and
around her. I&#8217;ll warrant she has never been
away from her home before. We must get
her confidence,&ndash;&ndash;devise ways to cheer her,
brighten her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can reason with her, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the time for reasoning, Father.
What we must do is to make her stop thinking,
stop looking backward and forward. And there
is Danton; he can help. He is of an age with
her, and should succeed where you and I might
fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has not awaited the suggestion, Captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. But he must,&ndash;&ndash;well, Father,
it has all been said. The maid is on our hands,
and must be got to Frontenac. That is all.
And there is nothing for it but to rely on
Danton to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest looked at his brushes, and hesitated.
&#8220;I am not certain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;she is
very young. And Lieutenant Danton,&ndash;&ndash;I
have heard, while at Quebec,&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a boy, Father. These tales may
be true enough. Why not? They would fit
as well any idle lieutenant in Quebec, who is
lucky enough to have an eye, and a pair of
shoulders, and a bit of the King&#8217;s gold in his
purse. This maid is the daughter of a gentleman,
Father; she is none of your Lower Town
jades. And Danton may be young and foolish,&ndash;&ndash;as
may we all have been,&ndash;&ndash;but he is a
gentleman born.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied the priest, looking with
regret at the failing light, and beginning to
gather his brushes. &#8220;I will counsel her, but I
fear it will do little good. If the maid is sick
at heart, and we attempt to guide her thoughts,
we may but drive the trouble deeper in. It is
the same with some of the Indian maidens,
when they have left the tribe for the Mission.
Now and again there comes a time, even with
piety to strengthen them,&ndash;&ndash;and this maid has
little,&ndash;&ndash;when the yearning seems to grow too
strong to be cured. Sometimes they go back.
One died. It was at Sault St. Francis in the
year of the&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; Menard broke in. &#8220;We have
only one fact to remember; there must be no
delay in carrying out the Governor&#8217;s orders.
We cannot change our plans because of this
maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must not let her understand, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard had been standing, with a shoulder
against the tree, alternately puffing at his pipe
and lowering it, scowling meanwhile at the
ground. Now he suddenly raised his head
and chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be many a year since I have played
the beau, Father. It may be that I have forgotten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
the r&ocirc;le.&#8221; He spread out his hands
and looked at the twisted fingers. &#8220;But I can
try, like a soldier. And there are three of us,
Father Claude, there are three of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to go back to the camp, but the
priest touched him.</p>
<p>&#8220;My son,&ndash;&ndash;perhaps, before you return, you
would look again at my unworthy portrait.
I&ndash;&ndash;about the matter of the canoe&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Menard, &#8220;you&#8217;ve taken it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it seemed best, considering the danger
that others might feel the same doubts which
troubled you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do that. The canoe was all
right, once the direction were decided on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Above all else, the true portrait should
convey to the mind of the observer the impression
that a single, an unmistakable purpose
underlies the work. When one considers&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true, Father, very true,&#8221; said Menard
abruptly, looking about at the beginning of the
twilight. &#8220;And now we had better get back.
The supper will be ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard strode away toward the camp. Father
Claude watched him for a time through the trees,
then turned again to the picture. Finally he got
together his materials, and carrying them in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
fold of his gown, with the picture in his left
hand, he followed Menard.</p>
<p>The maid was leaning back against the tree,
looking up at the sky, where the first red of the
afterglow was spreading. She did not hear
Menard; and he paused, a few yards away, to
look at the clear whiteness of her skin and the
full curve of her throat. Her figure and air,
her habits of gesture and step, and carriage of
the head, were those of the free-hearted maid
of the seignory. They told of an outdoor life,
of a good horse, and a light canoe, and the
inbred love of trees and sky and running water.
Here was none of the stiffness, the more than
Parisian manner, of the maidens of Quebec.
To stand there and look at her, unconscious as
she was, pleased Menard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, coming nearer, &#8220;will
you join us at supper?&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid looked at him with a slow blush
(she was not yet accustomed to the right of
these men to enter into the routine of her life).
Menard reached to help her, but she rose
easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Danton is not here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu, he walked away.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat about a log. Danton had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
strayed far, for he joined them shortly, wearing
a sulky expression. Menard looked about the
group. The maid was silent. Father Claude
was beginning at once on the food before him.
The twilight was growing deeper, and Guerin
dragged a log to the fire, throwing it on the
pile with a shower of sparks, and half a hundred
shooting tongues of flame. The Captain looked
again at Danton, and saw that the boy&#8217;s glance
shifted uneasily about the group. Altogether
it was an unfortunate start for his plan. But it
was clear that no other would break the ice,
so he drew a long breath, and plunged doggedly
into the story of his first fight on the St.
Lawrence.</p>
<p>It was a brave story of ambuscade and battle;
and it was full of the dark of night and the red
flash of muskets and the stealth and treachery
of the Iroquois soul. When he reached the
tale of the captured Mohawk, who sat against a
tree with a ball in his lungs, to the last refusing
the sacrament, and dying like a chief with the
death song on his lips, Danton was leaning
forward, breathless and eager, hanging on his
words. The maid&#8217;s eyes, too, were moist.
Then they talked on, Danton asking boyish
questions, and Father Claude starting over and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
again on a narrative of the wonderful conversion
of the Huron drunkard, Heroukiki, who,
in his zeal,&ndash;&ndash;and here Menard always swept in
with a new story, which left the priest adrift in
the eddies of the conversation. At last, when
they rose, and the dusk was settling over the
trees, the maid was laughing with gentle good
fellowship.</p>
<p>While they were eating, the <i>voyageurs</i> had
brought the canoe a short way up the bank,
resting it, bottom up, on large stones brought
from the shore. Underneath was a soft cot of
balsam; over the canoe were blankets, hanging
on both sides to the ground. Then Mademoiselle
said good-night, with a moment&#8217;s lingering
on the word, and a wistful note in her voice
that brought perhaps more sympathy than had
the sad eyes of the morning. For after all she
was only a girl, and hers was a brave little
heart.</p>
<p>The three men lay on the slope with hardly
a word, looking at the river, now shining like
silver through the trees. This new turn in
the life of the party was not as yet to be taken
familiarly. Father Claude withdrew early to
his meditations. Menard stretched out on his
back, his hands behind his head, gazing lazily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
at the leaves overhead, now hanging motionless
from the twigs.</p>
<p>Danton was sitting up, looking about, and
running the young reeds through his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Danton,&#8221; Menard said, after a long silence,
&#8220;I suppose you know that we have something
of a problem on our hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton looked over the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you thought about Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father Claude and I have been talking this
evening about her. I have thought that she
does not look any too strong for a hard journey
of a hundred and more leagues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has little colour,&#8221; said Danton, cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me, Danton, that you can help
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What seems to you the cause of the
trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Mademoiselle? She takes little impression
from the kindness of those about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come, Danton. You know better.
Even a boy of your age should see deeper than
that. You think she slights you; very likely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
she does. What of that? You are not here
to be drawn into a boy-and-girl quarrel with a
maid who chances to share our canoe. You
are here as my aid, to make the shortest time
possible between Quebec and Frontenac. If
she were to fall sick, we should be delayed.
Therefore she must not fall sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton had plucked a weed, and now was
pulling it to pieces, bit by bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop this moping, this hanging about.
Take hold of the matter. Devise talks, diversions;
fill her idle moments; I care not what
you do,&ndash;&ndash;within limits, my boy, within limits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Danton, &#8220;then you really want
me to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. I am too old myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton rose, and walked a few steps away
and back.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she will have none of me, Menard. It
is, &#8216;No, with thanks,&#8217; or, worse, a shake of the
head. If I offer to help, if I try to talk, if I&ndash;&ndash;oh,
it is always the same. I am tired of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard smiled in the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your reply to an order from your
superior officer, Danton?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy stood silent for a moment, then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
said, &#8220;I beg your pardon, Captain.&#8221; And with
a curious effort at stiffness he wandered off
among the trees, and was soon out of Menard&#8217;s
sight.</p>
<p>Menard walked slowly down to the fire,
opened his pack, and spreading out his blanket,
rolled himself in it with his feet close to the
red embers. For a long time he lay awake.
This episode took him back nearly a decade,
to a time when he, like Danton, would have lost
his poise at a glance from the nearest pair of
eyes. That the maid should so interest him
was in itself amusing. Had she been older
or younger, had she been any but the timid,
honest little woman that she was, he would
have left her, without a second thought, in the
care of the Commandant at Montreal, to be
escorted through the rapids by some later party.
But he had fixed his mind on getting her to
Frontenac, and the question was settled. His
last thought that night was of her quiet laughter
and her friendly, hesitating &#8220;good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was awakened in the half light before
the sunrise by a step on the twigs. At a little
distance through the trees was the maid, walking
down toward the water. She slipped easily
between the briers, holding her skirt close.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
From a spring, not a hundred yards up the
hillside, a brook came tumbling to the river,
picking its way under and over the stones and
the fallen trees, and trickling over the bank
with a low murmur. The maid stopped by a
pool, and kneeling on a flat rock, dipped her
hands.</p>
<p>The others were asleep. A rod away lay
Danton, a sprawling heap in his blanket. Menard
rose, tossed his blanket upon his bundle,
and walked slowly down toward the maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, you rise with the birds.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked around, and laughed gently. He
saw that she had frankly accepted the first little
change in their relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to be with the birds, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard had no small talk. He was thinking
of her evident lack of sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the best hour for the river, Mademoiselle.&#8221;
The colours of the dawn were beginning
to creep up beyond the eastern bank, sending
a lance of red and gold into a low cloud bank,
and a spread of soft crimson close after. &#8220;Perhaps
you are fond of the fish?&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid was kneeling to pick a cluster of
yellow flower cups. She looked up and nodded,
with a smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We fished at home, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go,&#8221; said Menard, abruptly. &#8220;I
will bring down the canoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw the blankets to one side, and stooping
under the long canoe, carried it on his
shoulders to the water. A line and hook were
in his bundle; the bait was ready at a turn of
the grass and weeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are two adventurers,&#8221; he said lightly, as
he tossed the line into the canoe, and held out
one of the paddles. &#8220;You should do your
share of the morning&#8217;s work, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed again, and took the paddle.
They pushed off; the maid kneeling at the
bow, Menard in the stern. He guided the
canoe against the current. The water lay flat
under the still air, reflecting the gloomy trees
on the banks, and the deepening colours of the
sky. He fell into a lazy, swinging stroke,
watching the maid. Her arms and shoulders
moved easily, with the grace of one who had
tumbled about a canoe from early childhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready, Mademoiselle?&#8221; He was heading
for a deep pool near a line of rushes. The
maid, laying down her paddle, reached back
for the line, and put on the bait with her own
fingers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>Menard held the canoe steady against the
current, which was there but a slow movement,
while she lowered the hook over the bow.
They sat without a word for some minutes.
Once he spoke, in a bantering voice, and she
motioned to him to be quiet. Her brows were
drawn down close together.</p>
<p>It was but a short time before she felt a jerk
at the line. Her arms straightened out, and she
pressed her lips tightly together. &#8220;Quick!&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Go ahead!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you hold it?&#8221; he asked, as he dipped
his paddle.</p>
<p>She nodded. &#8220;I wish the line were longer.
It will be hard to give him any room.&#8221; She
wound the cord around her wrist. &#8220;Will the
line hold, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. See if you can pull in.&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned back, and pulled steadily, then
shook her head. &#8220;Not very much. Perhaps,
if you can get into the shallow water&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard slowly worked the canoe through an
opening in the rushes. There was a thrashing
about and plunging not two rods away. Once
the fish leaped clear of the water in a curve of
clashing silver.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a salmon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A small one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>The maid held hard, but the colour had gone
from her face. The canoe drew nearer to the
shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold fast,&#8221; said Menard. He gave a last
sweep of the paddle, and crept forward to the
bow. Kneeling behind the maid, he reached
over her shoulder, and took the line below
her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful, M&#8217;sieu; it may break.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must risk it.&#8221; He pulled slowly in
until the fish was close under the gunwale.
&#8220;Now can you hold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She shook a straying lock of hair
from her eyes, and took another turn of the
cord around her wrist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady,&#8221; he said. He drew his knife, leaned
over the gunwale, and stabbed at the fighting
fish until his blade sank in just below the gills,
and he could lift it aboard.</p>
<p>The maid laughed nervously, and rested her
hands upon the two gunwales. Her breath
was gone, and there was a red mark around
her wrist where the cord had been. The canoe
had drifted into the rushes, and Menard went
back to his paddle, and worked out again into
the channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
have a breakfast of our own. You need not
paddle. I will take her down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her breath was coming back. She laughed,
and sat comfortably in the bow, facing Menard,
and letting her eyes follow the steady swing
and catch of his paddle. When they reached
the camp, the <i>voyageurs</i> were astir, but Danton
and the priest still slept. The first red glare
of the sun was levelled at them over the eastern
trees.</p>
<p>Menard made a fire under an arch of flat
stones, and trimming a strip of oak wood with
his hatchet, he laid the cleaned fish upon it and
kept it on the fire until it was brown and crisp.
The maid sat by, her eyes alert and her cheeks
flushed.</p>
<p>Danton was awake before the fish was
cooked, and he stood about with a pretence
of not observing them. The maid was fairly
aroused. She drew him into the talk, and
laughed and bantered with the two men as
prettily as they could have wished from a
Quebec belle.</p>
<p>All during the morning Danton was silent.
At noon, when the halt was made for the midday
lunch, he was still puzzling over the
apparent understanding between Mademoiselle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
and the Captain. Before the journey was taken
up, he stood for a moment near Menard, on the
river bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you asked me last night
to&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that I have misunderstood you.
Of course, if Mademoiselle&ndash;&ndash;if you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
caught himself.</p>
<p>Menard smiled; then he read the earnestness
beneath the boy&#8217;s confusion, and sobered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle and I went fishing, Danton.
Result,&ndash;&ndash;Mademoiselle eats her first meal. If
you can do as much you shall have my thanks.
And now remember that you are a lieutenant
in the King&#8217;s service.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE LONG ARROW.</h3>
</div>
<p>Menard allowed a halt of but a few hours
at Three Rivers. The settlement held little
of interest, for all the resident troops and most
of the farmers and <i>engag&eacute;s</i> had gone up the
river to join the army which was assembling at
Montreal. The close of the first week out of
Quebec saw the party well on the second half
of the journey to Montreal. As they went on,
Menard&#8217;s thoughts were drawn more deeply
into the work that lay ahead, and in spite of his
efforts at lightness, the work of keeping up the
maid&#8217;s spirits fell mostly to Danton (though
Father Claude did what he could). As matters
gradually became adjusted, Danton&#8217;s cheery,
hearty manner began to tell; and now that
there was little choice of company, the maid
turned to him for her diversion.</p>
<p>On the morning of the second day after
leaving Three Rivers, the two <i>voyageurs</i> were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
carrying the canoe to the water when Guerin
slipped on a wet log, throwing the canoe to the
ground, and tearing a wide rent in the bark.
Menard was impatient at this carelessness.
The knowledge that the Three Rivers detachment
had already gone on to Montreal had
decided him to move more rapidly, and he had
given orders that they should start each day in
the first light of the dawn. This was a chill
morning. A low, heavy fog lay on the river,
thinning, at a yard above the water, into a light
mist which veiled what colour may have been
in the east.</p>
<p>While Guerin and Perrot were patching the
canoe under Menard&#8217;s eye, Danton found some
dry logs under the brush, and built up the dying
fire, which was in a rocky hollow, not visible
from the river. Then he and the maid sat on
the rocks above it, where they could get the
warmth, and yet could see the river. Menard
and his men, though only a few rods away,
were but blurred forms as they moved about
the canoe, gumming the new seams.</p>
<p>The maid, save for an occasional heavy hour
in the late evenings, had settled into a cheerful
frame of mind. The novelty, and the many
exciting moments of the journey, as well as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
kindness of the three men, kept her thoughts
occupied. Danton, once he had shaken off his
sulky fits, was good company. They sat side
by side on the rock, looking down at the struggling
fire, or at the figures moving about the
canoe, or out into the white mystery of the
river, talking easily in low tones of themselves
and their lives and hopes.</p>
<p>The mist, instead of rising, seemed to settle
closer to the water, as the broad daylight came
across the upper air. The maid and Danton
fell into silence as the picture brightened. Danton
was less sensitive than she to the whims of
nature, and tiring of the scene, he was gazing
down into the fire when the maid, without a
word, touched his arm. He looked up at her;
then, seeing that her eyes were fixed on the
river, followed her gaze. Not more than a
score of yards from the shore, moving silently
through the mist, were the heads of three Indians.
Their profiles stood out clearly against
the white background; their shoulders seemed
to dissolve into the fog. They passed slowly
on up the stream, looking straight ahead, without
a twitch of the eyelids, like a vision from
the happy hunting-ground.</p>
<p>Danton slipped down from the rock, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
stepped lightly to Menard, pointing out the
three heads just as they were fading into the
whiteness about them. Menard motioned to
Guerin and Perrot to get the newly patched
canoe into the water, took three muskets, and
in a moment pushed off, leaving Danton with
the maid and the priest, who had retired a short
distance for his morning prayers. For a minute
the heads of the three white men were in sight
above the fog, then they too were swallowed up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what Menard thinks about them?&#8221;
said Danton, going back toward the maid.</p>
<p>She was still looking at the mist, and did not
hear him, so he took a seat at the foot of the
rock and rubbed the hammer of his musket,
which had been rusted by the damp. After a
time the maid looked toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Danton replied. &#8220;They
were going up-stream in a canoe, I suppose.
Probably he thinks they can give us some
information.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few minutes, during which the mist was
clearing under the rays of the sun, the two
canoes together came around a wooded point
and beached. The Indians walked silently to
the fire. They appeared not to see Danton and
the maid. Menard paused to look over his
canoe. It was leaking badly, and before joining
the group at the fire, he set the canoemen
at work making a new patch.</p>

&#8220;The Indians walked silently to the fire.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Danton,&#8221; he said, in a low tone, when he
reached the fire, &#8220;find the Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton hurried away, and Menard turned to
the largest of the three Indians, who wore the
brightest blanket, and had a peculiar wampum
collar, decorated in mosaic-like beadwork.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are travellers, like ourselves,&#8221; he said,
in the Iroquois tongue. &#8220;We cannot let you
pass without a word of greeting. I see that
you are of the Onondagas, my brothers. It
may be that you are from the Mission at the
Sault St. Francis Xavier?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian bowed. &#8220;We go from Three
Rivers to Montreal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I, too, am taking my party to Montreal.&#8221;
Menard thought it wise to withhold the further
facts of his journey. &#8220;Have you brothers at
Three Rivers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the Indian. &#8220;We have been
sent with a paper from the Superior at Sault
St. Francis Xavier to the good fathers at Three
Rivers. Now we are on our return to the
Mission.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have my brothers eaten?&#8221; Menard motioned
toward the fire. &#8220;It is still early in the
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three bowed. &#8220;We are travelling fast,&#8221;
said the spokesman, &#8220;for the Superior awaits
our return. We ate before the light. It will
soon be time for us to go on our journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard saw Father Claude and Danton approaching,
and waited for them. The face of
the large Indian seemed like some other face
that had had a place in his memory. It was not
unlikely that he had known this warrior during
his captivity, when half a thousand braves
had been to him as brothers. The Indian was
apparently of middle age, and had lines of dignity
and authority in his face that made it hard
to accept him as a subdued resident at the Mission.
But Menard knew that no sign of doubt
or suspicion must appear in his face, so he
waited for the priest. The Indians sat with
their knees drawn up and their blankets
wrapped about them, looking stolidly at the
fire.</p>
<p>Father Claude came quietly into the group,
and with a smile extended his hand to the
smallest of the three, an older man, with a
wrinkled face. &#8220;I did not look for you here,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Teganouan. Have you gone back to the
Mission?&#8221;</p>
<p>Teganouan returned the smile, and bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother has told the white man of our
errand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Menard, &#8220;they have been sent
to Three Rivers by the Superior, and are now
returning. I have told them that we, too, are
going to Montreal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest took the hint. &#8220;We shall meet
you and your brothers again, Teganouan.
They are newcomers at the Mission, I believe.
They had not come when I left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Father. They have but last week become
Christians. The Long Arrow&#8221; (inclining his
head toward the large Indian) &#8220;has lost a son, and
through his suffering was led to take the faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Long Arrow, who had seemed to lose
interest in the conversation as soon as he had
finished speaking, here rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brothers and the good Father will give
us their blessing? The end of the journey is
yet three days away. I had hoped that we
might be permitted to accept the protection of
the son of Onontio,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he looked at Menard,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;but
I see that his canoe will not be ready
for the journey before the sun is high.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
looked gravely from Menard to the priest, then
walked to the shore, followed by the others.
They pushed off, and shortly disappeared
around the point of land.</p>
<p>Menard gave them no attention, but as soon as
they were gone from sight, he turned to the priest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Father, what do you make of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, as yet, M&#8217;sieu. Do you know
who the large man is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I seem to remember him. And
what is more to the point, he certainly remembers
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He recognized me on the river. He came
back with me so willingly because he wanted
to know more about us. That was plain.
It would be well, Father, to enquire at the
Mission. We should know more of them
and their errand at Three Rivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard called Danton, and walked with him
a little way into the wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Danton,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are going through
this journey with us, and I intend that you
shall know about such matters as this meeting
with the Onondagas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they were Onondagas?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. They claim to be Mission Indians,
but neither the Father nor I altogether believe
them.&#8221; In a few sentences Menard outlined the
conversation. &#8220;Now, Danton, this may or may
not be an important incident. I want you to
know the necessity for keeping our own counsel
in all such matters, dropping no careless words,
and letting no emotions show. I wish you
would make a point of learning the Iroquois
language. Father Claude will help you. You
are to act as my right-hand man, and you may
as well begin now to learn to draw your own
conclusions from an Indian&#8217;s words.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton took eagerly to the lessons with
Father Claude, for they seemed another definite
step toward the excitement that surely, to
his mind, lay in wait ahead. The studying
began on that afternoon, while they were toiling
up against the stream.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the dusk was coming
down, and the little camp was ready for the
night, Menard came up from the heap of stores,
where the <i>voyageurs</i> had already stretched out,
and found the maid sitting alone by the fire.
Danton, in his rush of interest in the new study,
had drawn Father Claude aside for another
lesson.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle is lonely?&#8221; asked Menard,
sitting beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, M&#8217;sieu. I have too many thoughts
for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What interesting thoughts they must be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are, M&#8217;sieu. They are all about the
Indians this morning. Tell me, M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;they
called you Onontio. What does it
mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They called me the son of Onontio, because
of my uniform. Onontio, the Great Mountain,
is their name for the Governor; and the Governor&#8217;s
soldiers are to them his sons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They speak a strange language. It is not
the same as that of the Ottawas, who once
worked for my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know their tongue?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A few words, and some of the signs. This,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;raising
her hand, with the first finger extended,
and slowly moving her arm in a half
circle from horizon to horizon,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;this meant a
sun,&ndash;&ndash;one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard looked at her for a moment in silence.
He enjoyed her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you learn Iroquois? You would
enjoy it. It is a beautiful tongue,&ndash;&ndash;the language
of metaphor and poetry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to,&#8221; she replied, looking with
a faint smile at Danton and the priest, who
were sitting under a beech tree, mumbling in
low tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall join the class, Mademoiselle.
You shall begin to-morrow. It was thoughtless
of Danton to take the Father&#8217;s instruction
to himself alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then, M&#8217;sieu, I will know what the
Indians say when they sit up stiffly in their
blankets, and talk down in their throats. They
have such dignity. It is hard not to believe
them when they look straight at one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The three this morning,&ndash;&ndash;they did not
tell the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I understood that you did not believe
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where did Mademoiselle learn that?
Did she follow the conversation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but Lieutenant Danton&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded. Menard frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;He shouldn&#8217;t have done that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid looked surprised at his remark,
and the smile left her face. &#8220;Of course,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; she said, a little stiffly, &#8220;whatever is
not meant for my ears&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard was still frowning, and he failed to
notice her change in manner. He abruptly
gave the conversation a new turn, but seeing
after a short time that the maid had lost interest
in his sallies, he rose, and called to the
priest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, you are to have a new pupil.
Mademoiselle also will study the language of
the Iroquois. If you are quick enough with
your pupils, we shall soon be able to hold a conversation
each night about the fire. Perhaps,
if you would forego your exclusive air, Mademoiselle
would begin at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton, without waiting for the priest to
start, came hurriedly over and sat by the maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must pardon me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I did not
think,&ndash;&ndash;I did not know that you would be
interested. It is so dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid smiled at the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not ask,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and I could
not offer myself to the class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be splendid,&#8221; said Danton. &#8220;We
shall learn the language of the trees and the
grass and the rivers and the birds. And the
message of the wampum belt, too, we shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
know. You see,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;looking up at Menard,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;already
I am catching the meanings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard smiled, and then went down the
bank, leaving the three to bend their heads
together over the mysteries of the Iroquois
rules of gender, written out by Father Claude
on a strip of bark. It was nearly an hour later,
after the maid had crept to her couch beneath
the canoe, and Perrot and Guerin had sprawled
upon the bales and were snoring in rival keys,
that Danton came lightly down the slope humming
a drinking song. He saw Menard, and
dropped to the ground beside him, with a low
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle will lead my wits a chase,
Menard. Already she is deep in the spirit of
the new work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful, my boy, that she leads no more
than your wits a chase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there is great danger. What
a voice she has! I did not know it at first,
when she was frightened and spoke only in the
lower tones. Now when she speaks or laughs
it is like&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no fit simile in our tongue, light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
as it is. It may be that in the Iroquois I shall
find the words. It should be something about
the singing brooks or the voice of the leaves at
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lad was in such buoyant spirits that
Menard had to harden himself for the rebuke
which he must give. With the Indian tribes
Menard had the tact, the control of a situation,
that would have graced a council of great
chiefs; but in matters of discipline, the blunter
faculties and language of the white men seemed
to give his wit no play. Now, as nearly always,
he spoke abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten our talk of this morning,
Danton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the boy, looking up in surprise.</p>
<p>The night had none of the dampness that
had left a white veil over the morning just
gone. The moon was half hidden behind the
western trees. The sky, for all the dark, was
blue and deep, set with thousands of stars,
each looking down at its mate in the shining
water.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke of the importance of keeping our
own counsel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton began to feel what was coming. He
looked down at the ground without replying.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To-night Mademoiselle has repeated a part
of our conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&ndash;&ndash;why, she is one of our
party. She knows about us,&ndash;&ndash;who we are,
what we are going for&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have told her, Danton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could she help knowing? We are
taking her to Frontenac.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father Claude has not told her why we go
to Frontenac&ndash;&ndash;nor have I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Major Provost is her friend&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would never have told her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she seemed to know about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have talked it over with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&ndash;&ndash;that is, in speaking of our
journey we said something of the meaning of
the expedition. It could hardly be expected
that we,&ndash;&ndash;I fail to see, Captain, what it is you
are accusing me of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not been accused yet, Danton.
Let me ask you a question. Why did you
enter the King&#8217;s army?&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton hesitated, and started once or twice
to frame answer, but made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you wish a gay uniform, to please the
maids, to&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are unfair, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I wish to know. We will say, if you
like, that you have hoped to be a soldier,&ndash;&ndash;a
soldier of whom the King may one day have
cause to be proud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton flushed, and bowed his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I offered you the chance to go on this
mission, Danton, because I believed in you.
I believed that you had the making of a soldier.
This is not a child&#8217;s errand, this of ours. It is
the work of strong men. This morning I told
you of my talk with the three Onondagas
because I have planned to take you into my
confidence, and to give you the chance to make
a name for yourself. I made a point of the
importance of keeping such things to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mademoiselle, M&#8217;sieu, she is different&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the facts, Danton. I told you this
morning: within twelve hours you have passed
on your information. How do I know that you
would not have let it slip to others if you had
had the chance? You forget that Mademoiselle
is a woman, and the first and last duty of a
soldier is to tell no secrets to a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak wrongly of Mademoiselle. It is
cowardly to talk thus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard paused to get control of his temper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Cowardly, Danton? Is that the word you
apply to your commander?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your pardon, M&#8217;sieu! A thousand pardons!
It escaped me&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will pass it by. I want you to understand
this matter. Mademoiselle will spend a
night in Montreal. We shall leave her with
other women. A stray word, which to her
might mean nothing, might be enough to give
the wrong persons a hint of the meaning of our
journey. A moment&#8217;s nervousness might slip
the bridle from her tongue. All New France
is not so loyal that we can afford to drop a
chance secret here and there. As to this maid,
she is only a child, and by giving her our
secrets, you are forcing her to bear a burden
which we should bear alone. These Indians
this morning were spies, I am inclined to
believe, scouting along the river for information
of the coming campaign. The only way
that we can feel secure is by letting no word
escape our lips, no matter how trivial. I tell
you this, not so much for this occasion as for a
suggestion for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, M&#8217;sieu. You will please accept
my complete apologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to add, Danton, that if any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
further mistake of this kind occurs I shall be
forced to dismiss you from my service. Now
that I have said this, I want you to understand
that I don&#8217;t expect it to happen. I have believed
in you, Danton, and I stand ready to be
a friend to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard held out his hand. Danton clasped
it nervously, mumbling a second apology. For
a few moments longer they sat there, Menard
trying to set Danton at ease, but the boy was
flushed, and he spoke only half coherently.
He soon excused himself and wandered off
among the trees and the thick bushes.</p>
<p>During the next day Danton was in one of
his sullen moods. He worked feverishly, and,
with the maid, kept Father Claude occupied
for the greater part of the time, as they paddled
on, with conversation, and with discussion of
the Iroquois words. The maid felt the change
from the easy relations in the party, and
seemed a little depressed, but she threw herself
into the studying. Often during the day
she would take up a paddle, and join in the
stroke. At first Menard protested, but she
laughed, and said that it was a &#8220;rest&#8221; after
sitting so long.</p>
<p>They were delayed on the following day by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
a second accident to the canoe, so that they
were a full day late in reaching Montreal.
They moved slowly up the channel, past the
islands and the green banks with their little log-houses
or, occasionally, larger dwellings built
after the French manner. St. Helen&#8217;s Island,
nearly opposite the city, had a straggling cluster
of hastily built bark houses, and a larger group
of tents where the regulars were encamped,
awaiting the arrival of Governor Denonville
with the troops from Quebec.</p>
<p>Menard stopped at the island, guiding the
canoe to the bank where a long row of canoes
and bateaux lay close to the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might get out and walk around,&#8221; he
said to the others. &#8220;I shall be gone only a few
moments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude sat on the bank, lost in meditation.
Danton and the maid walked together
slowly up and down, beyond earshot from the
priest. Since Menard&#8217;s rebuke, both the lad
and the maid had shown a slight trace of resentment.
It did not come out in their conversation,
but rather in their silences, and in the
occasions which they took to sit and walk apart
from the others. It was as if a certain common
ground of interest had come to them. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
maid, for all her shyness and even temper, was
not accustomed to such cool authority as Menard
was developing. The priest was keeping
an eye on the fast-growing acquaintanceship,
and already had it vaguely in mind to call it
to the attention of Menard, who was getting
too deeply into the spirit and the details of his
work to give much heed.</p>
<p>Menard was soon back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Push off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Major is not
here. We shall have to look for him in the
city.&#8221;</p>
<p>They headed across the stream. The city
lay before them, on its gentle slope, with the
mountain rising behind like an untiring sentry.
It was early in the afternoon, and on the river
were many canoes and small boats, filled with
soldiers, friendly Indians, or <i>voyageurs</i>, moving
back and forth between the island and the city.
They passed close to many of the bateaux,
heaped high with provision and ammunition
bales, and more than once the lounging soldiers
rose and saluted Menard.</p>
<p>At the city wharf he turned to Danton.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have to get a larger canoe, Danton,
and a stronger. Will you see to it, please?
We shall have two more in our party from now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
on. Make sure that the canoe is in the best of
condition. Also I wish you would see to getting
the rope and the other things we may need
in working through the rapids. Then spend
your time as you like. We shall start early in
the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard and Father Claude together went
with the maid to the Superior, who arranged
for her to pass the night with the sisters.
Then Menard left the priest to make his final
arrangements at the Mission, and went himself
to see the Commandant, to whom he outlined
the bare facts of his journey to Frontenac.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing that most concerns you,&#8221; he said
finally, &#8220;is a meeting I had a few days ago with
three Indians down the river. One called himself
the Long Arrow, and another was Teganouan,
who, Father de Casson tells me, recently
left the Mission at the Sault St. Francis Xavier.
They claim to be Mission Indians. It will be
well to watch out for them, and to have an eye
on the Richelieu, and the other routes, to make
sure that they don&#8217;t slip away to the south with
information.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied the Commandant. &#8220;I imagine
that we can stop them. Do you feel safe
about taking this maid up the river just now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Our men are scattered along the
route, are they not?&#8221; Menard asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a number are out establishing Champigny&#8217;s
transport system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t look for any trouble. But I should
like authority for one or two extra men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take anything you wish, Menard. I will
get word over to the island at once, giving you
all the authority you need.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>DANTON BREAKS OUT.</h3>
</div>
<p>When Menard reached the wharf, early on
the following morning, he found Father
Claude waiting for him. The new canoe lay
on the wharf, and beside it was a heap of stores.
Perrot and the two new <i>engag&eacute;s</i> sat on the
edge of the wharf. The sun had just risen
over the trees on St. Helen&#8217;s Island, and the
air was clear and cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Perrot,&#8221; said Menard, as he unslung
his musket and horn, &#8220;is everything ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Guerin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not seen him, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard turned to the priest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Father. You are on time,
I see; and that is more than we can say for
Danton. Where is the boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has gone for Mademoiselle St. Denis,
Captain. He was here before the sunrise,
checking up the stores.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Learning to work, is he? That is a good
sign. And how about yourself? Did you
pick up anything yesterday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the priest. &#8220;I enquired at the
Mission about Teganouan and his companions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is known of them. Teganouan
had been one of the worst drunkards among
the Onondagas, and his conversion, a year ago,
was thought to be one of our greatest victories
for the faith. His penances were among the
most complete and purging ever&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just before I left the Mission for Quebec,
Teganouan went on an errand to the city and
fell among some of our fellow-countrymen who
were having a drinking bout. For a few days
after that he wavered, and fell again. Once
afterward he was seen in company with two
low fellows, <i>coureurs de bois</i>, who have since
been confined under suspicion of communicating
with the enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has returned to the Mission, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he disappeared some time ago. They
do not know the Long Arrow. I described
him to Brother de Lamberville&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he is here now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It seems, further, that all the other
workers among the Iroquois have had word and
are returning. That much of my labour is removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do they get this word?&#8221; said Menard,
impatiently. &#8220;That is the old question. It is
enough to make one wonder if there are any
secrets kept from the enemy&#8217;s country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one seems to know, M&#8217;sieu. The
Superior told me last night that they had not
been sent for, so it would seem that the
information must have reached them through
the Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The folly of these new governors!&#8221; Menard
strode back and forth. &#8220;Oh, it makes
one sigh for old Frontenac. He never walked
blindfolded into such a trap as this. But go
on. You were speaking of Father de Lamberville.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was only that I described the Long
Arrow to Brother de Lamberville. He seemed
to remember such a wampum collar as the Long
Arrow wore. He could not recall exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we may as well forget the incident.
It seems that we are to know nothing of it.
Here is Danton.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lieutenant and the maid were walking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
rapidly down to the wharf. Mademoiselle was
in a gay mood after her few hours of enjoyment
among the comforts of a city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; she called, waving her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said Menard, shortly. He
did not look a second time, to see her smile
fade, for Guerin had not appeared, and he was
rapidly losing patience. He walked up and
down the wharf for a few moments, while
Danton found a seat for the maid and the
two talked together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perrot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do you know where
Guerin was last evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, M&#8217;sieu. He was at the inn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was he doing? Drinking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go up there, on the run. If you don&#8217;t find
him there, come right back, for we can&#8217;t wait
much longer for anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perrot ran up the street and disappeared.
In a few moments he came in sight, striding
down between the row of houses, holding
Guerin firmly by one arm. The young fellow
was hanging back, and stumbling in limp fashion.
He was evidently drunk. Danton, who
had joined Menard when the two men appeared,
said, &#8220;Heavens, he must have started early!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>Some distance behind Perrot and Guerin
came a ragged crowd of woodsmen, singing,
jeering, and shouting, and bearing broad traces
of a sleepless night.</p>
<p>Menard stood waiting with a look of disgust.
When they came upon the wharf Guerin
laughed, and tried to get out a flippant apology
for his tardiness; but Menard seized him
before the words were off his lips, and dragging
him across the wharf threw him into the
water. Then he turned to Perrot, and said,
&#8220;Pull him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two new men stood uneasily near, with
startled faces. Behind them the maid was sitting,
a frightened look in her eyes. Danton
had risen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear away from here!&#8221; Menard called to
the drunken rabble, who had collected a few
rods away, and were now hesitating between
laughter and fright. They stood looking at
each other and at Menard, then they slunk
away.</p>
<p>In all an hour had gone before they were
ready to start. Guerin was weak and shivering
from his plunge, but Menard ordered him
into the canoe. The incident drew a cloud
over the maid&#8217;s spirits, and altogether depressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
the party, so that not until afternoon did they
get into conversation. By that time they were
past the Lachine Rapids and the Sault St.
Louis, where the men made a portage, and
Danton led the maid along the bank through
the tangled brush and briers. When at last
they were ready to push on across Lake St.
Louis the maid&#8217;s skirt was torn in a dozen places,
and a thorn had got into her hand, which Danton
carefully removed with the point of his knife,
wincing and flushing with her at each twinge of
pain. During the rest of the day, they had an
Iroquois lesson, and by the end of the afternoon
when the sun was low, and Menard headed for
the shore of Isle Perrot, the maid was bright
again, laughing over Danton&#8217;s blunders in the
new language.</p>
<p>They spent the next day on the island, for
what with wind and rain the lake was impassable
for their canoe. The men built a hut of
brush and bark which sheltered the party from
the driving rain. Menard&#8217;s mood lightened at
the prospect of a rest, and he started a long
conversation in Iroquois which soon had even
Father Claude laughing in his silent way.
The rain lessened in the afternoon, but the
wind was still running high. Menard and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
<i>engag&eacute;s</i> went out early in the afternoon and
repacked all the supplies, in order that the
weight might be distributed more evenly in
the canoe. With this and other work he was
occupied until late in the afternoon. Father
Claude took the occasion for a solitary walk,
and for meditation. When Menard entered
the hut he found the maid sitting with her head
resting against one of the supporting trees.
She wore a disturbed, unsettled expression.
Danton evidently had been sitting or standing
near her, for when Menard entered, stooping,
he was moving across the hut in a hesitating,
conscious manner. The Captain looked at
them curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have to take away a part of
your house to pay for your supper,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Everything is wet outside that might do for
firewood. Lend a hand, Danton.&#8221; He gathered
logs and sticks from the floor and walls,
and carried them out. Danton, after a quick
look toward the maid (which, of course, Menard
saw), did the same.</p>
<p>The Captain was the first to reenter the hut.
The maid had not moved, and her eyes were
puzzled and wearied, but she tried to smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it stopped raining?&#8221; she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Menard gave her an amused glance, and
pointed to a sparkling beam of sunlight that
came slanting in through an opening in the
wall, and buried itself in a little pool of light on
the trampled ground. She looked at it, flushed,
and turned her eyes away. He stood for a moment,
half minded to ask the question that was
on his tongue, but finally held it back. In a
moment Danton came back, looking suspiciously
at each of them as he stooped to gather
another armful of wood.</p>
<p>Menard was thoughtful during the evening
meal. Afterward he slipped his arm through
Father Claude&#8217;s, and led him for a short walk,
giving him an account of the incident. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t say anything at the time,&#8221; he concluded,
&#8220;partly because I thought I might be mistaken,
and partly because it would have been the
worst thing I could do. I begin to see&ndash;&ndash;I
should have foreseen it before I spoke to him
about the girl&ndash;&ndash;that we have trouble ahead,
Father, with these precious children. I confess
I don&#8217;t know just what to do about it. We
must think it over. Anyway, you had better
talk to her. She would tell you what she
wouldn&#8217;t tell me. If he&#8217;s annoying her, we
must know it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>Father Claude was troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;The maid is in our care,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
also in that of Lieutenant Danton. It would
seem that he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use in expecting him to take
any responsibility, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you are right. He is a
child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you go to the maid, Father, and get
straight at the truth? You see that I cannot
meddle with her thoughts without danger of
being misinterpreted. It is you who must be
her adviser.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest acquiesced, and they returned to
the camp, to find the maid still sitting alone,
with a troubled face, and Danton puttering
about the fire with a show of keeping himself
occupied. They ate in silence, in spite of
Menard&#8217;s efforts to arouse them. After the
meal they hung about, each hesitating to wander
away, and yet seeing no pleasure in gathering
about the fire. Menard saw that Father
Claude had it in mind to speak to the maid, so
he got Danton away on a pretext of looking
over the stores. But he said nothing of the
episode that was in all their minds, preferring
to await the priest&#8217;s report.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>After the maid had gone to her couch beneath
the canoe, and Danton had wandered
into the wilderness that was all about them,
Father Claude joined Menard at the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Father, what word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Softly, M&#8217;sieu. It is not likely that she
sleeps as yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have talked long with her, but she is of a
stubborn mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was angry at first. She spoke hastily,
and asked me in short terms to leave her in
solitude. And then, after a time, when she
began to see that it was her welfare and our
duty which I had in mind, and not an idle curiosity,
she was moved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she speak then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu, she wept, and insisted that
there was no trouble on her mind,&ndash;&ndash;it was
merely the thought of her home and her father
that had cast her down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so she has pride,&#8221; mused Menard.
&#8220;Could you gather any new opinions, Father?
Do you think that they may already have come
to some understanding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think so, M&#8217;sieu. But may I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
suggest that it would be well to be firm with
Lieutenant Danton? He is young, and the
maid is in our trust,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, Father. I will account for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>There seemed to be nothing further to do at
the moment, so the priest went to his blanket,
and Menard drew a bundle under his head and
went to sleep, after a glance about the camp to
see that the sentry was on watch. Now that
Montreal lay behind, and the unsettled forest
before, with only a thin line of Frenchmen
stretched along the river between them and
Fort Frontenac, he had divided the night into
watches, and each of the four <i>engag&eacute;s</i> stood his
turn.</p>
<p>The following day was all but half gone
before the wind had dropped to a rate that
made the passage of the lake advisable.
Menard ordered the noon meal for an hour
earlier than usual, and shortly afterward they
set out across the upper end of Lake St. Louis
to the foot of the cascades. Before the last
bundle had been carried up the portage to
Buisson Pointe, the dusk was settling over the
woods across the river, and over the rising ground
on Isle Perrot at the mouth of the Ottawa.</p>
<p>During the next day they passed on up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
stream to the Coteau des Cedres. Menard and
Father Claude were both accustomed to take
the rapid without carrying, or even unloading,
but Danton looked at the swirling water with
doubt in his eyes. When the maid, leaning
back in the canoe while the men halted at the
bank to make fast for the passage, saw the
torrent that tumbled and pitched merrily down
toward them, she laughed. To hold a sober
mood for long was not in her buoyant nature,
and she welcomed a dash of excitement as a
relief from the strained relations of the two
days just gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; she called to Menard, with a
sparkle in her eyes. &#8220;Oh, M&#8217;sieu, may I stay
in the canoe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton turned quickly at the sound of her
voice, and a look, half of pain, half of surprise,
came over his face as he saw her eagerness.
Menard looked at her in doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be a wet passage, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not, M&#8217;sieu? Have I not been
wet before? See, I will protect myself.&#8221; She
drew the bundles closely about her feet, and
threw a blanket across her knees. &#8220;Now I
can brave the stream, Captain. Or,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;her
gay tone dropped, and she looked demurely at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
him,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;perhaps it is that I am too heavy, that
I should carry myself up the bank. I will obey
my orders, Captain.&#8221; But as she spoke she
tucked the blanket closer about her, and stole
another glance at Menard.</p>
<p>He smiled. He was thinking of Madame
Gordeau and her fragile daughter, who had
shuddered with fear at a mere glimpse of the
first rapid. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Mademoiselle
shall stay in the canoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is not safe&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;broke in Danton,
stepping forward. Then, conscious of the blunder,
he turned away, and took up the rope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay hold, boys,&#8221; said Menard.</p>
<p>Perrot and one of the new men waded into
the water, and laid hold of the gunwales on
each side of the bow. Menard himself took
the stern. He called to Danton, who stood
awkwardly upon the bank, &#8220;Take the rope
with the men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guerin made the rope fast and set out ahead,
with the other men and Danton close behind.
Father Claude rolled up his robe and joined
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; called Menard, as the rope straightened.
&#8220;Mademoiselle, I am sorry to disturb you,
but if you will sit farther back you will have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
less trouble from the spray.&#8221; He waded along
the side, and helped her to move nearer the
stern, placing the bundles and the blanket
about her as before. Then he shouted, &#8220;All
right,&#8221; and they started into the foaming water.</p>
<p>They toiled slowly up the incline, catching
at rocks to steady their course, and often
struggling for a foothold. Once Menard
ordered a halt at a large rock, and all
rested for a moment.</p>
<p>When they started again, the men at the bow
of the canoe had some trouble in holding it
steady, for their feet were on a stretch of smooth
rock, and Menard called Danton back to help
them. The boy worked his way along the rope,
and reached the bow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come around behind Perrot,&#8221; said Menard.</p>
<p>Danton reached around Perrot&#8217;s body, and
caught hold of the gunwale. At that moment
his foot slipped, and he fell, dragging the side
of the canoe down with him. The men at the
bow did their best to prevent a capsize, but succeeded
only in keeping half the bundles in the
canoe. The others, the muskets, and the maid
went into the river.</p>
<p>Menard moved forward as rapidly as he could
against the current. The maid was unable at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
once to get her feet, used as she was to the
water, and was swept down against him. He
caught her, and, steadying himself with one
hand, by the water-logged canoe, raised her
head and held her while she struggled for a
footing and shook the water from her eyes.
Before she was wholly herself, Danton came
plunging toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give her to me!&#8221; he said huskily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
drowned her! My God, let me have her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; said Menard, sternly. &#8220;Take the
men, and go after those bales&ndash;&ndash;quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton looked stupidly at him and at the
maid, who was wiping the water from her face
with one hand, and holding tightly to the Captain.
Then he followed Perrot, who had already,
with the two new men and Father Claude,
commenced to get together the bales, most of
which had sunk, and were moving slowly along
the bottom. Menard still had his arm about
the girl&#8217;s shoulders. He helped her to the
shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep moving, Mademoiselle,&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t sit
down. In a moment we shall have a fire.
Father Claude,&#8221; he called, &#8220;bring the canoe
ashore.&#8221; Then to the maid, &#8220;There are yet
some dry blankets, thank God.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>Mademoiselle was herself now, and she protested.
&#8220;But it is only water, M&#8217;sieu. Let me
go on with you, beyond the rapids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard merely shook his head. The canoe
was soon on the bank, and emptied of water.
The other men were beginning to come in with
soaked bundles and dripping muskets. Each
bale was opened, and the contents spread out to
dry, while Guerin was set to work at drying the
muskets with a cloth. Perrot and Danton
built a rough shelter for the maid, enclosing a
small fire, and gave her some dry blankets.
Then each man dried himself as best he could.</p>
<p>This accident threw Danton into a fit of
gloominess from which nothing seemed to
arouse him. He was careless of his duty, and
equally careless to the reprimands that followed.
This went on for two days, during which the
maid seemed at one moment to avoid him, and
at another to watch for his coming. In the
evening of the second day following, the party
camped at Pointe &agrave; Baudet, on Lake St. Francis.
The supper was eaten in a silence more oppressive
than usual, for neither Menard nor Father
Claude could overcome the influence of Danton&#8217;s
heavy face and the maid&#8217;s troubled eyes.
After the supper the two strolled away, and sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
just out of earshot on a mossy knoll. For hours
they talked there, their voices low, save once
or twice when Danton&#8217;s rose. They seemed to
have lost all count of time, all heed of appearances.
Menard and the priest made an effort
at first to appear unobservant, but later, seeing
that their movements were beyond the sight of
those unheeding eyes, they took to watching
and speculating on the course of the conversation.
The night came on, and the dark closed
over them. Still the murmur of those low voices
floated across the camp.</p>
<p>Father Claude, with a troubled mind, went
down to the water, and walked slowly up and
down. Menard saw to the final preparations for
the night, and posted the first sentry. Then
he joined the priest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is time to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear it is, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must leave it in your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I go now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further words, Father Claude walked
up the bank, crackling through the bushes.
From this spot the voices were inaudible, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
for a few moments there was no sound. Then
Menard could hear some one moving heavily
through the undergrowth, going farther and
farther into the stillness, and he knew that it
was Danton. He sat on the bank with his back
against a tree, and waited for a long hour. At
last he dropped asleep.</p>
<p>He was awakened by Father Claude. The
priest dropped to the ground beside him. His
training had given Menard the faculty of awaking
instantly into full grasp of a situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where is the maid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has gone to her couch, but not to sleep,
I fear. It has come, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Danton has lost his senses. He asks her
to marry him, to flee with him. It is a difficult
case. She has had no such experience before,
and knows not how to receive him. She seems
to have no love for him, beyond the pleasure
his flattery has given her. She believes all he
says. One thing I know, aside from all questions
of expediency, of care for our trust, this
must not go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for the present, at least. She may do
what she will, once we have taken her safely to
Frontenac.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu; not even then. We must stop
it at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course,&#8221; said Menard; &#8220;so far as we
are concerned, we have no choice. You need
not bother longer to-night. I will wait for the
boy. I am sorry for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have more pity, if I knew less of
his past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tush, Father! He is not a bad fellow, as
they go. To be sure he does not rise any too
well to new responsibilities, but he will grow
into it. It is better an honest infatuation with
the daughter of a gentleman than a dishonest
one with an Indian maid. And you know our
officers, Father. God knows, they are all bad
enough; and yet they are loyal fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, M&#8217;sieu, I fear you will be too lenient
with him. Believe me, we have not a minute to
waste in stopping the affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have no fear, Father. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard lay on the bank, gazing at the sparkling
water, and listening to the slow step of
the sentry and to the deeper sounds of the forest.
Another hour crept by, and still Danton
had not returned. Menard walked about the
camp to make sure that he was not already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
rolled in his blanket; then he went to the sentry,
who was leaning against a tree a few rods
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colin,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have you seen Lieutenant
Danton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, M&#8217;sieu. He is up there.&#8221; Colin
pointed through the trees that fringed the
river. &#8220;I heard a noise some time ago, and
went up to see. He is lying under a beech
tree, if he has not moved,&ndash;&ndash;and I should
have heard him if he had. It may be that he
is asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard nodded, and walked slowly along
the bank, bending aside the briers that caught
at his clothes and his hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>THE FIGHT AT LA GALLETTE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Danton was lying on the ground, but he
was not asleep. He looked up, at the sound
of Menard&#8217;s footsteps, and then, recognizing
him, lowered his eyes again. The Captain hesitated,
standing over the prostrate figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Danton,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;I want you to
tell me the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy made no reply, and Menard, after
waiting for a moment, sat upon a log.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have decided to do rather an unusual
thing, Danton,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;in offering to
talk it over with you as a friend, and not as an
officer. In one thing you must understand me:
Mademoiselle St. Denis has been intrusted to
my care, and until she has safely reached those
who have a right to share the direction of her
actions, I can allow nothing of this sort to go
on. You must understand that. If you will
talk with me frankly, and try to control yourself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
for the present, it may be that I can be of
service to you later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long silence. Finally, Danton
spoke, without raising his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there need of this, M&#8217;sieu? Is it not
enough that she&ndash;&ndash;that Mademoiselle dismisses
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Menard, &#8220;that is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure of yourself, Danton? sure
that you have not made a mistake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A mistake?&#8221; The boy looked up wildly.
&#8220;I was&ndash;&ndash;shall I tell you, M&#8217;sieu?&ndash;&ndash;I left the
camp to-night with the thought that I should
never go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you plan to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know now. Back
to Montreal, perhaps to the Iroquois. I don&#8217;t
care where.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not bring your musket. It would
hardly be safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe!&#8221; There was weary contempt in the
boy&#8217;s voice. He sat up, and made an effort to
steady himself, leaning back upon his hands.
&#8220;I should not say this. It was what I thought
at first. I am past it now; I can think better.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
It was only your coming,&ndash;&ndash;when I first saw
you, it came rushing back, and I wanted to&ndash;&ndash;oh,
what is the use? You do not know. You
cannot understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Captain, I ask for a release. Let me
go back to Montreal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you go? You have no canoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it is too late. In
the first place, you would never reach the city.
There are scouting bands of Iroquois all along
the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much the better, M&#8217;sieu, so&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait. That is only one reason. I cannot
spare you. I have realized within the last day
that I should have brought more men. The
Iroquois know of our campaign; they are
watching us. A small party like this is to
their liking. I will tell you, Danton, we may
have a close rub before we get to Frontenac.
I wish I could help you, but I cannot. What
reason could I give for sending you alone down
the river to Montreal? You forget, boy, that
we are not on our own pleasure; we are on the
King&#8217;s errand. For you to go now would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
to take away one of our six fighting men,&ndash;&ndash;to
imperil Mademoiselle. And that, I think,&#8221;
he looked keenly at Danton, &#8220;is not what you
would wish to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s face was by turns set and working.
He looked at Menard as if to speak, but got
nothing out. At last he sprang to his feet, and
paced back and forth between the trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; he said half to himself.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t stay! I can&#8217;t see her every day, and
hear her voice, and sit with her at every meal.
Why do you call yourself my friend, Menard?
Why don&#8217;t you help? Why don&#8217;t you say
something&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some things, Danton, that a man
must fight out alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton turned away, and stood looking over
the river. Menard sat on the log and waited.
The moments slipped by, and still they said
nothing. They could hear the stirring of Colin,
back at the camp, and the rustle of the low night
breeze. They could almost hear the great silent
rush of the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Danton.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy half turned his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will stay here and play the man. You
will go on with your duties; though, if the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
arrangement be too hard, I will be your master
in the Iroquois study, leaving Mademoiselle to
Father Claude. And now you must return to
the camp and get what sleep you can. Heaven
knows we may have little enough between here
and Frontenac. Come.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up, and walked to the camp, without
looking around. Danton lingered until the
Captain&#8217;s tall figure was blending with the
shadows of the forest, then he went after.</p>
<p>During the following day they got as far as
the group of islands at the head of Lake St.
Francis. Wherever possible Menard was now
selecting islands or narrow points for the camp,
where, in case of a night attack, defence would
be a simple problem for his few men. Also,
each night, he had the men spread a circle of
cut boughs around the camp at a little distance,
so that none could approach without some slight
noise. Another night saw the party at the foot
of Petit Chesneaux, just above Pointe Maligne.</p>
<p>While Perrot was preparing the supper, and
Danton, with the <i>voyageurs</i>, was unpacking the
bales, Menard took his musket and strode off
into the forest. There was seldom a morning
now that the maid did not have for her breakfast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
a morsel of game
which the Captain&#8217;s musket
had brought down.</p>
<div class="image-left"> <img alt='map' src='images/illus-map.png' /><br />

<p class='image-caption'>
<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Note.</span>&ndash;&ndash;By this picture-writing the Long Arrow (of the clan of the
Beaver) tells the Beaver (of the same clan) that he has taken up the hatchet
against the party in the canoe, and he asks the Beaver to assist him. The
parallel zigzag lines under the long arrow tell that he is travelling by the
river, and the two straight lines under these that he has two warriors with
him. The attack is to be made in either three or four sleeps, or days, as
indicated by the three finished huts and one unfinished.<br /><br />

The Beaver has seen this sign, as shown by his signature at the bottom. The
seventeen slanting lines under the foot mean that he has seventeen warriors
and they are travelling on foot, southward, as shown by the fact that the
lines slope toward the sun.<br /><br />

That the figures in the canoe are French is shown by their hats. The priest
has no paddle, the maid is represented with long hair.
</p>

</div>
<p>In half an hour he returned,
and sought Father
Claude; and after a
few low words the two
set off. Menard led the
way through thicket and
timber growth, over a
low hill, and down into a
hollow, where a well-defined
Indian trail crossed
a brook. Here was a
large sugar maple tree
standing in a narrow
opening in the thicket.
Menard struck a light,
and held up a torch so
that the priest could
make out a blaze-mark
on the tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; said Menard.
&#8220;It is on the old trail.
I saw it by the merest
chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude bent forward, with his eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
close to the inscription that had been painted
on the white inner bark, with charcoal and
bear&#8217;s grease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you read it?&#8221; asked Menard, holding
the torch high.</p>
<p>The priest nodded. Both of these men knew
the Indian writing nearly as well as their own
French.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not know of the two men you got
at Montreal, M&#8217;sieu. He tells of only six in
our canoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No? But that matters little. The Beaver
has hurried after him with nearly a score.
They can give us trouble enough. What do
you make of the huts? Do they mean three
days or four?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks to me,&#8221; said the priest slowly,
&#8220;that he was interrupted in drawing the
fourth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Menard threw his torch into the
brook, and turned away into the dusk of the
thicket,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;we know enough. The fight will
be somewhere near the head of the rapids.
Perhaps they will wait until we get on into the
islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And meantime,&#8221; said the priest, as they
crackled through the undergrowth, &#8220;we shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
say nothing of this to Lieutenant Danton or
the maid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Menard replied.</p>
<p>In three days more they had passed Rapide
Flat, after toiling laboriously by the Long Sault.
They were a sober enough party now, oppressed
with Danton&#8217;s dogged attention to duty and
with the maid&#8217;s listless manner.</p>
<p>They were passing a small island the next
morning, when Perrot gave a shout and stopped
paddling.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Menard, sharply.</p>
<p>Perrot pointed across a spit of land. In the
other channel they could see a bateau just
disappearing behind a clump of trees. It was
headed down-stream. Menard swung the canoe
about, and they skirted the foot of the island.
Instead of a single bateau there were some
half dozen, drifting light down the river, with
a score of <i>coureurs de bois</i> and <i>voyageurs</i>
under the command of a bronzed lieutenant,
Du Peron, a sergeant, and a corporal. The
lieutenant recognized Menard, and both parties
landed while the two officers exchanged news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you spare me a few men?&#8221; Menard
asked, when they had drawn apart from the
others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>The lieutenant&#8217;s eye roamed over the group
on the beach, where the men of both parties
were mingling.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many do you want? I&#8217;m running
shorthanded. We have all we can manage
with these bateaux.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a war party of twenty on my trail,&#8221;
said Menard. &#8220;If I had my own men with
me I should feel safe, but I have my doubts
about these fellows. I haven&#8217;t room for more
than two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&ndash;&ndash;that La Grange
affair?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that they had a price on your head.
There&#8217;s been a good deal of talk about it at
Frontenac. A converted Mohawk has been
scouting for us, and he says that the Onondagas
blame you for that whole galley business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Menard, grimly. &#8220;You could
hardly expect them to get the truth of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was bad work, Menard, bad work. The
worst thing La Grange did was to butcher
the women and children. He was drunk at
the time, and the worst of it was over before
d&#8217;Orvilliers got wind of it. Do you know who
is leading this war party?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Long Arrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. A big fellow, with a rather noticeable
wampum collar. He came to Frontenac as
a Mission Indian, but got away before we suspected
anything. Our scout told me that his
son was in the party that was taken to the galleys.
He&#8217;s been scouting along the river ever
since. Likely as not he followed you down to
Quebec. How many men have you now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five, and Father Claude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He could shoot at a pinch, I suppose. I&#8217;ll
let you have the best two I have, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
Du Peron shrugged his shoulders&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;you
know the sort that are assigned for this transport
work. They&#8217;re a bad lot at best. But they
can shoot, and they hate the Iroquois, so you&#8217;re
all right if you can keep them sober. That
will make nine, with yourself,&ndash;&ndash;it should be
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be enough. How is the transport
moving?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendidly. Whatever we may say about
the new Governor, our Intendant knows his
business. I judge from the way he is stocking
up Frontenac, that we are to use it as the base
for a big campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so. You will report, will you, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Montreal, that we were safe at Rapide Flat?
And if you find a <i>coureur</i> going down to
Quebec, I wish you would send word to Provost
that Mademoiselle St. Denis is well and
in good spirits.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lieutenant looked curiously at the maid,
who was walking with Father Claude near the
canoe. Then the two officers shook hands, and
in a few moments were going their ways, Menard
with two villainous <i>voyageurs</i> added to his
crew. That afternoon he passed the last rapid,
and beached the canoe at La Gallette, thankful
that nothing intervened between them and
Fort Frontenac but a reach of still water and
the twining channels of the Thousand Islands,
where it would call for the sharpest eyes ever
set in an Iroquois head to follow his movements.</p>
<p>They ate an early supper, and immediately
afterward Father Claude slipped away. The
maid looked after him a little wistfully, then
she wandered to the bank, and found a mossy
seat where she could watch the long rapid, with
its driving, foaming current that dashed over
the ledges and leaped madly around the jagged
rocks. Menard set his men at work preparing
the camp against attack. When this was well
under way he called Danton, who was lying by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
the fire, and spent an hour with him conversing
in Iroquois. By that time the twilight was
creeping down the river. Menard left the boy
to form a speech in accord with Iroquois tradition,
and went on a tour of inspection about
the camp. The new men had swung thoroughly
into the spirit of their work; one of them was
already on guard a short way back in the
woods. The other men were grouped in a
cleared place, telling stories and singing.</p>
<p>Father Claude came hurriedly toward the
fire, looking for Menard. His eyes glowed
with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; he said, in an eager voice, &#8220;come.
I have found it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has come to me,&ndash;&ndash;about the canoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard looked puzzled, but the priest caught
his arm, and led him away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It came while we ate supper. The whole
truth, the secret of the allegory, flashed upon
me. I have worked hard, and now it is done.
Instead of leaving out the canoe, I have put it
back, and have placed in it six warriors, three
paddling toward the chapel, and three away
from it. Over them hovers an angel,&ndash;&ndash;a mere
suggestion, a faint, shining face, a diaphanous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
form, and outspread hands. Thus we symbolize
the conflict in the savage mind at the first entrance
of the Holy Word into their lives, with
the blessed assurance over all that the Faith
must triumph in the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the last words, he stopped and drew
Menard around to face the portrait of the
Lily of the Onondagas, which was leaning
against a stump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it too dark, M&#8217;sieu? See, I will bring it
closer.&#8221; He lifted the picture, and held it close
to Menard&#8217;s eyes. He was trembling with the
excitement of his inspiration.</p>
<p>The Captain stepped back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to know, Father, where you
have had this picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in my bundle. I have&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;for the
first time he saw the sternness in Menard&#8217;s
face, and his voice faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not leave it at Montreal?&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude slowly lowered the canvas to
the ground. The light had gone out of his
eyes, and his face was white. Then suddenly
his thin form straightened. &#8220;I had forgotten.
It was M&#8217;sieu&#8217;s order. See,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he suddenly
lifted the picture over his head and whirled to
the stump,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;it shall go no farther. We will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
leave it here for the wolves and the crows and
the pagan redmen.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dashed it down with all his strength, but
Menard sprang forward, and caught it on his
outstretched arm. &#8220;No, Father,&#8221; he said; &#8220;we
will take it with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest smiled wearily, and lowered the
picture to the ground; but when Menard said,
&#8220;You have broken it,&#8221; he raised it hastily, and
examined it. One corner of the wooden frame
was loosened, but the canvas was not injured.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can mend it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Then they walked to the camp together,
without talking; and Menard helped him repair
the frame, and pack the picture carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is it that it was not ruined in the
capsize at Coteau des Cedres?&#8221; Menard asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was preserved by a miracle, M&#8217;sieu. This
bundle did not leave the canoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <i>voyageurs</i>, still lounging in the clearing,
were laughing and talking noisily. The Captain,
after he had prepared the maid&#8217;s couch,
and bade her good-night, called to them to be
quiet. For a time the noise ceased, but a little
later, as he was spreading his blanket on the
ground, it began again, and one of the transport
men sang the opening strain of a ribald
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
song. Menard strode over to the group so
quickly that he took them by surprise. Colin
was slipping something behind him, but he
could not escape Menard&#8217;s eye. In a moment
he was sprawling on his face, and a brandy flask
was brought to light. Menard dashed it against
a tree, and turned to the frightened men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to your blankets, every man of you.
There are Iroquois on this river. You have
already made enough noise to draw them from
half a league away. The next man that is
caught drinking will be flogged.&#8221; He thought
of the maid lying under her frail shelter, for
whose life he was responsible. &#8220;If it occurs
twice, he will be shot. Perrot, I want you to
join the sentry. From now on we shall have
two men on guard all night. See that there is
no mistake about this. At the slightest noise,
you will call me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men slunk to their blankets, and soon
the camp was still.</p>
<p>The river sang as it rushed down its zigzag
channel through the rocks,&ndash;&ndash;a song that
seemed a part of the night, and yet was distinct
from the creeping, rustling, dropping, all-pervading
life and stir of the forest. Every
leaf, every twig and root, every lump of sod
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
and rock-held pool of stagnant water, had its
own miniature world, where living things were
fighting the battle of life. In the far distance,
perhaps, an owl hooted; or near at hand a flying
squirrel alighted on a bending elm-twig. Deer
and moose followed their beaten tracks to the
streams that had been theirs before ever Frenchman
pierced the forest; beaver dove into their
huts above the dams their own sharp teeth had
made; moles nosed under the rich soil, and left
a winding track behind; frogs croaked and
bellowed from some backset of the river,&ndash;&ndash;and
all blended, not, perhaps, so much into a sound,
as into a sense of movement,&ndash;&ndash;an even murmur
in a low key, to which the lighter note of
the water was apart and distinct.</p>
<p>To a man trained as Menard had been, this
was companionship. He was never alone in
the forest, never without his millions of friends,
who, though they seldom came into his thoughts,
were yet a part of him, of his sense of life and
strength. And through all these noises, even
to the roar of Niagara itself, he could sleep
like a child, when the slightest sound of a
moccasined foot on a dry leaf would have
aroused him at the instant to full activity.
To-night he lay awake for a long time. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
every day that he drew nearer the frontier
came graver doubts of the feasibility of the
plan which had been intrusted to him. The
wretched business of La Grange&#8217;s treachery
and the stocking of the King&#8217;s galleys had
probably alienated the Onondagas for all time.
Their presence on the St. Lawrence pointed to
this. He felt safe enough, personally, for the
very imprudence of the Governor&#8217;s campaign,
which had made it known so early to all the
Iroquois, was an element in his favour. The
Iroquois, unlike many of the roaming western
tribes, had their settled villages, with lodges
and fields of grain to defend from invasion.
One secret of the campaign had been well
kept; no one save the Governor&#8217;s staff and
Menard knew that the blow was to fall on the
Senecas alone. And Menard was certain
enough in his knowledge of Iroquois character
to believe that each tribe, from the Mohawks
on the east to the Senecas on the west, would
call in its warriors, and concentrate to defend
its villages. Therefore there could be no strong
force on the St. Lawrence, where the French
could so easily cut it off. As for the Long
Arrow and his band, eight good fighting men
and a stout-hearted priest could attend to them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>No, the danger would begin after the maid
was safe at Frontenac, and he and Danton and
Father Claude must set out to win the confidence
of the Onondagas. The Oneidas and
Mohawks must not be slighted; but the Onondagas
and Cayugas, being the nearest to the
Senecas, and between them and the other nations,
would likely prove to be the key to the situation.</p>
<p>The night was black when he awoke.
Clouds had spread over the sky, hiding all but
a strip in the west where a low line of stars
peeped out. This strip was widening rapidly
as the night breeze carried the clouds eastward.
At a little distance some of the men were whispering
together and laughing softly. A hand
was feeling his arm, and a voice whispered,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, M&#8217;sieu; something has happened!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Colin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Guerin was on guard with me, and
he fell. I thought I heard an arrow, but could
not be sure. I looked for him after I heard
him fall, but could not find him in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard sprang to his feet, with his musket,
which had lain at his side every night since
leaving Montreal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was Guerin, Colin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight back from the river, a few rods.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
He had spoken but a moment before. It must
have told them where to shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call the men, and draw them close in a
circle.&#8221; Menard felt his way toward the fire,
where a few red embers showed dimly, and
roused Danton with a light touch and a whispered
caution to be silent. Already he could
hear the low stir of the <i>engag&eacute;s</i> as they slipped
nearer the fire. He walked slowly toward the
river, with one hand stretched out in front, to
find the canoe. It was closer than he supposed,
and he stumbled over it, knocking one
end off its support. The maid awoke with a
gasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, silence!&#8221; he whispered,
kneeling beside her. &#8220;I fear we are attacked.
You must come with me.&#8221; He had to say it
twice before she could fully understand, and
just then an arrow sang over them, and struck
a tree with a low <i>thut</i>. He suddenly rose and
shouted, &#8220;Together, boys! They will be on
us in a moment. Close in at the bank, and
save your powder. Perrot, come here and help
me with the canoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a burst of yells from the dark in
answer to his call, and a few shots flashed.
Danton was rallying the men, and calling to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
them to fall back, where they could take cover
among the rocks and trees of the bank.</p>
<p>The maid was silent, but she reached out
her hand, and Menard, catching her wrist,
helped her to her feet, and fairly carried her
down the slope of the bank, laying her behind
the tangled roots of a great oak. Already the
sky was clearer, and the trees and men were
beginning to take dim shape. The river rushed
by, a deeper black than sky and woods, with a
few ghostly bits of white where the foam of
the rapids began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay here,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t move
or speak. I shall not be far.&#8221;</p>
<p>She clung to his hand in a dazed manner,
but he gently drew his away, and left her crouching
on the ground.</p>
<p>The men were calling to one another as they
dodged back from tree to tree toward the river,
shooting only when a flash from the woods
showed the position of an Indian. Some of
them were laughing, and as Menard reached
the canoe Perrot broke into a jeering song.
It was clear that the attacking party was
not strong. Probably they had not taken into
account the double guard, relying on the death
of the sentry to clear the way for a surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perrot!&#8221; called the Captain. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you come here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The song stopped. There was a heavy noise
as the <i>voyageur</i> came plunging through the
bushes, drawing a shower of arrows and musket
balls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful, Perrot, careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t hit me,&#8221; said Perrot, laughing.
He stumbled against the Captain, stepped back,
and fell over the canoe, rolling and kicking.
Menard sprang toward him and jerked him up.
He smelled strongly of brandy.</p>
<p>Menard swore under his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick up your musket. Take hold of that
canoe,&ndash;&ndash;quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Perrot was frightened by his stern words,
and he succeeded in holding up an end of the
canoe, while Menard pushed him down the
slope to the water&#8217;s edge. They rushed back,
and in a few trips got down most of the stores.
By this time Perrot was sobering somewhat,
and with the Captain he took his place in the
line. The men were shooting more frequently
now, and by their loose talk showed increasing
recklessness. Calling to Danton, Menard finally
made them understand his order to fall back.
Before they reached the bank, Colin dropped,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
with a ball through the head, and was dragged
back by Danton.</p>
<p>They dropped behind logs and trees at the
top of the slope. It began to look as if the
redmen were to get no closer, in spite of
the drunken condition of all but one or two of
the men. Though the night was now much
brighter, they were in the shadow, and neither
the Captain nor Danton observed that the
brandy which the transport men had supplied
was passing steadily from hand to hand. They
could not know that the boy Guerin lay on
his back amid the attacking Onondagas, an
arrow sticking upright in his breast, one hand
lying across his musket, the other clasping a
flask.</p>
<p>The maid had not moved. She could be
easily seen now in the clearer light, and Menard
went to her, feeling the need of giving her
some work to occupy her mind during the strain
of the fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>She looked up. He could see that she was
shivering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must ask you to help me. We must get
the canoe into the water. They will soon tire
of the assault and withdraw; then it will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
safe to take to the canoe. They cannot hurt
you. We are protected by the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>He helped her to rise, and she bravely threw
her weight on the canoe, which Menard could
so easily have lifted alone, and stood at the
edge of the beach, passing him the bundles,
which he, wading out, placed aboard. But
suddenly he stopped, with an exclamation, peering
into the canoe.</p>
<p>The maid, dreading each moment some new
danger, asked in a dry voice, &#8220;What is it,
M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>For reply he seized the bundles, one at a
time, and tossed them ashore, hauling the canoe
after, and running his hand along the bark.</p>
<p>The maid stepped to his side. There was a
gaping hole in the side of the canoe. She
drew her breath in quickly, and looked up at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Perrot,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;that fool
Perrot.&#8221; He stood looking at it, as if in doubt
what to do. Up on the bank the men, Danton
and Father Claude among them, were popping
away at the rustling bushes. Suddenly he
turned and gazed down at the maid&#8217;s upturned
face. &#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do not think
there is danger, but whatever happens you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
must keep close to me, or to Danton and Father
Claude. It may be that there will be moments
when we cannot stop and explain to you as I
am doing now, but you must trust us, and believe
that all will come out well. The other
men are not themselves to-night&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped. It was odd that he should so
talk to a maid while his men were fighting for
their lives; but the Menard who had the safety
of this slender girl in his hands was not the
Menard of a hundred battles gone by. So he
lingered, not knowing why, save that he hoped
for some word from her lips of confidence in
those who wished to protect her. And, as he
waited, she smiled with trembling lips, and
said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will come out well, M&#8217;sieu. I&ndash;&ndash;I am
not afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Menard went up the bank with a
bound, and finding one man already in a stupor,
and another struggling for a flask, which Father
Claude was trying to take away from him, he
laid about him with his hard fists, and shortly
had the drunkards as near to their senses as
they were destined to be during the short space
they had yet to live.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>A COMPLIMENT FOR MENARD.</h3>
</div>
<p>Colin and Guerin were dead, and one of
the transport men lay in a drunken sleep,
so that including Menard, Danton, and Father
Claude there were six men in the little half
circle that clung to the edge of the bank, shooting
into the brush wherever a twig stirred or
a musket flashed. &#8220;There are not many of
them,&#8221; said Menard to Danton, as they lay
on their sides reloading. He listened to the
whoops and barks in an interval between shots.
&#8220;Not a score, all told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will they come closer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You won&#8217;t catch an Iroquois risking
his neck in an assault. They&#8217;ll try to pick us
off; but if we continue as strong as we are now,
they are likely to draw off and try some other
devilment, or wait for a better chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton crept back to his log for another
shot. Now that the sky was nearly free of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
clouds, and the river was sparkling in the starlight,
the Frenchmen could not raise their heads
to shoot without exposing a dim silhouette to
the aim of an Indian musket. Father Claude,
who was loading and firing a long <i>arquebuse &agrave;
croc</i>, had risen above this difficulty by heaping
a pile of stones. Kneeling on the slope, a pace
below the others, and resting the crutch of his
piece in a hollow close to the stones, he could
shoot through a crevice with little chance of
harm, beyond a bruised shoulder.</p>
<p>The maid came timidly up the bank, and
touched Menard&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Mademoiselle? You must not
come here. It is not safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to speak to you, M&#8217;sieu. If I could
have your knife&ndash;&ndash;for one moment&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want of a knife, child? It is
best that you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; There was a fusillade from
the brush, and his voice was lost in the uproar.
&#8220;You must wait below, on the beach. They
cannot get to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the canoe, M&#8217;sieu. The cloth about
the bales is stout,&ndash;&ndash;I can sew it over the hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard looked at her as she crouched by his
side; her hair fallen about her face and shoulders;
her hands, grimy with the clay of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
bank, clinging to a wandering root. She was
still trembling with excitement, but her eyes
were bright and eager. Without a word he
drew his knife from its sheath, and held it out.
She took it, and was down the slope with a
light spring, while the Captain poked the muzzle
of his musket through the leaves. As he
drew it back, after firing, he caught a glimpse
of Danton&#8217;s face, turned toward him with a
curious expression. The boy laughed nervously,
and wiped the sweat from his blackened forehead.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t give us much rest, Captain,
do they?&#8221; Menard&#8217;s reply was jerked out
with the strokes of his ramrod: &#8220;They will&ndash;&ndash;before
long&ndash;&ndash;and we can&ndash;&ndash;take to the
canoe. We&#8217;re letting them have all they want.&#8221;
He peered through the leaves, and fired quickly.
A long shriek came from the darkness. Menard
laughed. &#8220;There&#8217;s one more gone,
Danton.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fight went on slowly, wretchedly, shot
for shot, Danton himself dragging up a bale of
ammunition and serving it to the men. The
maid, unaided, had overturned the canoe where
it lay, and with quickened breath was pressing
her needle through the tough bark. Danton
lost the flint from his musket, and crept down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
the bank to set a new one. Suddenly he exclaimed,
&#8220;There goes Perrot!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old <i>voyageur</i> had, in a fit of recklessness,
raised his head for a long look about the
woods. Now he was rolling slowly down the
slope toward the canoe and the maid, clutching
weakly at roots and bushes as he passed. There
was a dark spot on his forehead. Menard
sprang after, and felt of his wrists; the pulse
was fluttering out. He looked up, to see the
maid dipping up water with her hollowed hands,
and waved her back.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no use, Mademoiselle. Is the canoe
ready? We may need it soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood motionless, slowly shaking her
head, and letting the water spill from her hands
a drop at a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back there. Do what you can with it.&#8221;
He hurried up the bank and fell into his place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see what they are doing?&#8221; asked
Danton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Playing the devil. Anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lieutenant pointed to an arrow that
was sticking in a tree beside him, slanting
downward. &#8220;They are climbing trees. Listen.
You can hear them talking, and calling down.
I&#8217;ve fired, but I don&#8217;t get them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>Menard listened closely, and shot for the
sound, but with no result.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to stop this, Danton. I don&#8217;t
understand it. It isn&#8217;t like the Iroquois to
keep at it after a repulse. Tell Father Claude;
he is shooting too low.&#8221; Menard glanced along
the line at his men. The drunken transport
man lay silent at his post; beyond him were
his mate and one of the Montreal men, both of
them reckless and frightened by turns, shooting
aimlessly into the dark. The arrows were
rattling down about them now. One grazed
Father Claude&#8217;s back as he stooped to take
aim, and straightened him up with a jerk. A
moment later a bullet sang close past Menard&#8217;s
head. He looked for the maid; she was sitting
by the canoe, sewing, giving no heed to the
arrows.</p>
<p>The Montreal man groaned softly, and flattened
out, with an arrow slanting into the small
of his back; which so unmanned the only other
conscious <i>engag&eacute;</i> that he sank by him, sobbing,
and trying to pull out the arrow with his hands.
Menard sprang up.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, Danton! Father Claude! This
is massacre. Run for the canoe. My turn,
eh?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Danton. &#8220;Did they
get you?&#8221;</p>
<p>For reply, Menard tore an arrow from the
flesh of his forearm and dashed down the bank,
musket in hand. The maid was tugging at
the canoe, struggling to move it toward the
water. She did not look up to see the yellow,
crimson, and green painted figures rise from
the reeds that fringed the water but a few yards
away; she did not hear the rush of moccasined
feet on the gravel. Before she could turn, she
was seized and thrown to the ground, surrounded
by the Indians, who were facing about
hastily to meet Menard. The Captain came
among them with a whirl of his musket that
sent one warrior to the ground and dropped
another, half stunned, across the canoe. Danton
was at his heels, and Father Claude, fighting
like demons with muskets and knives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Mademoiselle!&#8221; Menard lifted her
as he spoke, and swung her behind him; and
then the three were facing the group of howling,
jumping figures, which was increased rapidly
by those who had followed the Frenchmen
down the bank. &#8220;Come back here, Father.
Protect the maid! They dare not attack you,
if you drop your musket! Loose your hold,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Mademoiselle.&#8221; He caught roughly at the
slender arms that held about his waist, parrying
a knife stroke with his other hand. &#8220;They
will kill you if you cling to me. Now, Danton!
Never mind your arm. I have one in the hand.
Fight for the maid and France!&#8221; Menard was
shouting for sheer lust and frenzy of battle,
&#8220;What is the matter with the devils? Why
don&#8217;t they shoot? God, Danton, they&#8217;re coming
at us with clubs!&#8221; He called out in the
Iroquois tongue: &#8220;Come at us, cowards!
Make an end of it! Where are your bows?
your muskets? Where is the valour of the
Onondagas&ndash;&ndash;of my brothers?&#8221;</p>
<p>The last words brought forth a chorus of
jeers and yells. The two officers stood side by
side at the water&#8217;s edge. Behind them, knee-deep
in the water, was Father Claude, holding
the maid in his arms. The Indians seemed to
draw together, still with that evident effort to
take their game alive, for two tall chiefs were
rushing about, cautioning the warriors. Then,
of a sudden, the whole body came forward with
a rush, and Menard, Danton, Father Claude,
and the maid went down; the three men fighting
and splashing until they lay, bound with
thongs, on the beach.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>Menard turned his head and saw that Danton
lay close to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle?&#8221; he said. &#8220;What have they
done with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is here.&#8221; The reply was in Father
Claude&#8217;s voice. It came from the farther side
of Danton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But they have bound her and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bound you!&#8221; The Captain tried to sit up,
but could not. &#8220;They would not do that,
Father. It is a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>A warrior, carrying a musket under his arm,
walked slowly around the prisoners, making
signs to them to be silent. The others had
withdrawn to the shadow of the bank; the
sound of their voices came indistinctly across
the strip of shore. Indifferent to the pain in
his arm, Menard struggled at his thongs, and
called to them in Iroquois: &#8220;Who of my
brothers has bound the holy Father? What
new fear strikes the breasts of the sons of the
night-wind that they must subdue with force
the gentle spirit of their Father, who has given
his years for his children? Is it not enough
that you have broken the faith with your
brother, the child of your own village, the son
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
of your bravest chief? Need you other prey
than myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>The guard stood over Menard, and lifted his
musket. Menard laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strike me, brave warrior. Show that your
heart is still as fond as on the day I carried
your torn body on my shoulder to the safety of
your lodge. Ah, you remember? You have
not forgotten the Big Buffalo? Then, why do
you hesitate? The man who has courage to
seize a Father of the Church, surely can strike
his brother. This is not the brave Tegakwita
I have known.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude broke in on Menard, whose
voice was savage in its defiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have patience, M&#8217;sieu. I will speak.&#8221; He
lifted his voice. &#8220;Teganouan! Father
Claude awaits you.&#8221; There was no reply from
the knot of warriors at the bank, and the priest
called again. Finally a chief came across and
looked stolidly at the prisoners.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Father called?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Father is grieved, Long Arrow, that
you would bind him like a soldier taken in war.&#8221;
The priest&#8217;s voice was gentle. &#8220;Is this the
custom of the Onondagas? It was not so when
I served you with Father de Lamberville.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;My Father fought against his children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have slain me, Long Arrow,
had I not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian walked slowly back to his braves,
and for some moments there was a consultation.
Then the other chief came to them, and, without
a word, himself cut the thongs that bound
the priest&#8217;s wrists and ankles. There was no
look of recognition in his eyes as he passed
Menard, though they had been together on
many a long hunt. He was the Beaver.</p>
<p>As the Captain lay on his back, looking first
at the kneeling Indian, then at the sky overhead,
he was thinking of the Long Arrow,
again with a half-memory of some other occasion
when they had met. Then, slowly, it
came to him. It was at the last council to decide
on his release from captivity, five years
before. The Long Arrow had come from a
distant village to urge the death of the prisoner.
He had argued eloquently that to release Menard
would be to send forth an ungrateful son
who would one day strike at the hand that
had befriended him.</p>
<p>Father Claude was on his feet, chafing his
wrists and talking with the Beaver. The Long
Arrow joined them, and for a few moments the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
chiefs reasoned together in low, dignified tones.
Then, at a word from the Beaver, and a grunt
of disgust from the Long Arrow, Father Claude,
with quick fingers, set the maid free, and took
her head upon his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they hurt her, Father?&#8221; asked Menard,
in French.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu, I think not. It is the excitement.
The child sadly needs rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will they release you? It is not far to
Frontenac. It may be that you can reach
there with Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my son.&#8221; The priest paused to dip up
some water, and to stroke the maid&#8217;s forehead
and wrists. &#8220;They have some design which
has not been made clear to me. They have
promised not to bind me or to injure what
belongs to me among the supplies. But the
Beaver threatens to kill us if we try to escape,
Mademoiselle and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do they hold you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To let no word go out concerning your
capture. I fear, M&#8217;sieu&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest lowered his eyes to the maid, who
still lay fainting, and said no more. A long
hour went by, with only a commonplace word
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
now and then between the prisoners. The
maid revived, and sat against the canoe, gazing
over the water that swept softly by. Danton
lay silent, saying nothing. Once a groan
slipped past the Captain&#8217;s lips at a twitch of
his wounded arm, and Father Claude, immediately
cheered by the prospect of a moment&#8217;s
occupation, cleaned the wound with cool water,
and bandaged it with a strip from his robe.</p>
<p>Preparations were making for a start. A
half-dozen braves set out, running down the
beach; and shortly returned by way of the river
with two canoes. The others had opened the
bales of supplies (excepting Father Claude&#8217;s
bundle, which he kept by him), and divided
the food and ammunition among themselves.
The two chiefs came to the prisoners, and
seated themselves on the gravel. The Long
Arrow began talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother, the Big Buffalo, is surprised
that he should be taken a prisoner to the villages
of the Onondagas. He thinks of the
days when he shared with us our hunts, our
lodges, our food, our trophies; when he lived a
free life with his brothers, and parted from
them with sadness in his voice. He had a
grateful heart for the Onondagas then. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
he left our lodges he placed his hand upon the
hearts of our chiefs, he swore by his strange
gods to keep the pledge of friendship to his
brothers of the forest. Moons have come and
gone many times since he left our villages.
The snow has fallen for five seasons between
him and us, to chill his heart against those
who have befriended him. Twice has he been
in battle when we might have taken him a
prisoner, but the hearts of our braves were
warm toward him, and they could not lift their
arms. When there have been those who have
urged that the hatchet be taken up against
him, many others have come forward to say,
&#8216;No; he will yet prove our friend and our
brother.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard lay without moving, looking up at
the stars. Danton, by his side, and the maid,
sitting beyond, were watching him anxiously.
Father Claude stood erect, with folded arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; continued the chief, &#8220;now that
Onontio, the greatest of war chiefs, thinks
that he is strong, and can with a blow destroy
our villages and drive us from the lands our
gods and your gods have said to be ours by
right, as it was our fathers&#8217;,&ndash;&ndash;now there is no
longer need for the friendship of the Onondagas,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
whose whole nation is fewer than the fighting
braves of the great Onontio. The war-song
is sung in every white village. The great
canoes take food and powder up our river,
for those who would destroy us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard was still looking upward. &#8220;My
brother,&#8221; he said, speaking slowly, &#8220;was once
a young brave. When he was called before
his great chief, and commanded to go out and
fight to save his village and his brothers and
sisters, did he say to his chief: &#8216;No, my father,
I will no longer obey your commands. I will
no longer strive to become a famous warrior of
your nation. I will go away into the deep
forest,&ndash;&ndash;alone, without a lodge, without a
nation, to be despised alike by my brothers
and my foes?&#8217; Or did he go as he was bid,
obeying, like a brave warrior, the commands of
those who have a right to command? Does
not the Long Arrow know that Onontio is the
greatest of chiefs, second only to the Great-Chief-Across-the-Water,
the father of red men
and white men? If Onontio&#8217;s red sons are disobedient,
and he commands me to chastise
them, shall I say to my father, &#8216;I cannot obey
your will, I will become an outcast, without
a village or a nation?&#8217; The Long Arrow is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
wise man. He knows that the duty of all is to
obey the father at Quebec.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo speaks with wisdom. But
it may be he forgets that our braves have
passed him by in the battles of every season
since he left our villages. He forgets that he
met a band of peaceful hunters from our nation,
who went into his great stone house because
they believed that his white brothers, if not
himself, would keep the word of friendship.
He forgets that they were made to drink of
the white man&#8217;s fire water, and were chained
together to become slaves of the great kind
Chief-Across-the-Water, who loves his children,
and would make them mighty in his land. Is
this the father he would have us obey? Truly,
he speaks with an idle tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard lay silent. His part in La Grange&#8217;s
treachery, and in carrying out later the Governor&#8217;s
orders, would be hard to explain. To lay
the blame on La Grange would not help his
case, at least until he could consult with Father
Claude, and be prepared to speak deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother does not reply?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will ask a question,&#8221; replied Menard.
&#8220;What is the will of the chiefs to do with the
sons of Onontio?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo has seen the punishment
given by the Onondagas to those who have
broken their faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. And of course we shall be
taken to your villages before this death shall
come?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Long Arrow bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Menard, in his slow voice.
&#8220;As the Long Arrow, brave as he is, is but a
messenger, obeying the will of the nation, I will
withhold my word until I shall be brought
before your chiefs in council. I shall have
much to say to them; it need be said only
once. I shall be pleased to tell my truths to
the Big Throat, whose eyes can see beyond the
limits of his lodge; who knows that the hand
of Onontio is a firm and strong hand. He
shall know from my lips how kind Onontio
wishes to be to his ungrateful children&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
He paused. The Indians must not know yet
that the Governor&#8217;s campaign was to be directed
only against the Senecas. The mention of the
Big Throat would, he knew, be a shaft tipped
with jealousy in the breast of the Long Arrow.
The Big Throat, Otreouati, was the widest
famed orator and chief of the Onondagas; and
it was he who had adopted Menard as his son.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
Above all, the Long Arrow would not dare
to do away with so important a prisoner before
he could be brought before the council.</p>
<p>The maid was leaning forward, following
their words intently. &#8220;Oh, M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I cannot understand it all. What will they
do with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard hesitated, and replied in French without
turning his head: &#8220;They will take us to
their villages below Lake Ontario. They will
not harm you, under Father Claude&#8217;s protection.
And then it is likely that we may be
rescued before they can get off the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But yourself, M&#8217;sieu? They are angry
with you. What will they do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Danton and I must look out
for ourselves. I shall hope that we may find
a way out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Long Arrow was looking closely at
them, evidently resenting a woman&#8217;s voice in
the talk. At the silence, he spoke in the same
low voice, but Menard and Father Claude read
the emotion underneath.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that the Big Buffalo has never
had a son to brighten his days as his life
reaches the downward years. It may be that
he has not watched the papoose become a fleet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
youth, and the youth a tireless hunter. He
may not have waited for the day when the
young hunter should take his seat at the council
and speak with those who will hear none but
wise men. I had such a son. He went on the
hunt with a band that never returned to the
village.&#8221; His voice rose above the pitch customary
to a chief. It was almost cold in its
intensity. &#8220;I found his body, my brother, the
body of my son, at this place, killed by the
white men, who talked to us of the love of their
gods and their Chief-Across-the-Water. Here
it was I found him, who died before he would
become the slave of a white man; and here I
have captured the man who killed him. It is
well that we have not killed my brother to-night.
It is better that we should take him alive before
the council of the Onondagas, who once were
proud in their hearts that he was of their own
nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid&#8217;s eyes, shining with tears, were
fixed on the Indian&#8217;s face. She had caught up
with her hand the flying masses of her hair and
braided them hastily; but still there were locks
astray, touched by the light of the starlit sky.
Menard turned his head, and watched her during
the long silence. Danton was watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
her too. He had not understood the chief&#8217;s
story, but it was clear from her face that she
had caught it all. It was Father Claude who
finally spoke. His voice was gentle, but it had
the air of authority which his long experience
had taught him was necessary in dealing with
the Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo has said wisely. He will
speak only to the great chiefs of the nation, who
will understand what may be beyond the minds
of others. The heart of the Long Arrow is
sad, his spirit cast down, and he does not see
now what to-morrow he may,&ndash;&ndash;that the hand
of the Big Buffalo is not stained with the blood
of his son. We will go to your village, and
tell your chiefs many things they cannot yet
know. For the Big Buffalo and his young
brother, I shall ask only the justice which the
Onondagas know best how to give. For myself
and my sister, I am not afraid. We will
follow your course, to come back when the
chiefs shall order it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two Indians exchanged a few signs, rose,
and went to the scattered group of braves, who
were feasting on the white men&#8217;s stores. In a
moment these had thrown the bundles together,
and were getting the canoes into the water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
Two warriors cut Danton&#8217;s thongs and raised
him to his feet. He rubbed his wrists, where
the thongs had broken the skin, and stepped
about to get the stiffness from his ankles.
Then he bent down to set Menard loose,
but was thrown roughly back.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this? What&#8217;s the matter? Do
you understand this, Menard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; replied the Captain, quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little compliment to me, that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton stood looking at him in surprise,
until he was hustled to the nearest canoe and
ordered to take a paddle. He looked back and
saw four warriors lift Menard, still bound hand
and foot, and carry him to the other canoe, laying
him in the bottom beneath the bracing-strips.
Father Claude, too, was given a paddle.
Then they glided away over the still water, into
a mysterious channel that wound from one
shadow-bound stretch to another, past islands
that developed faintly from the blackness ahead
and faded into the blackness behind. The
lean arms of the Indians swung with a tireless
rhythm, and their paddles slipped to and fro
in the water with never a sound, save now and
then a low splash.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE MAID MAKES NEW FRIENDS.</h3>
</div>
<p>The prisoners were allowed some freedom
in the Onondaga village. They were not
bound, and they could wander about within call
of the low hut which had been assigned to them.
This laxity misled Danton into supposing that
escape was practicable.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; he said to Menard, &#8220;no one is watching.
Once the dark has come we can slip
away, all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see the two warriors sitting by the
hut yonder,&ndash;&ndash;and the group playing platter
among the trees behind us? Did you suppose
they were idling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem to sleep often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could not do it. We shall hope to
get away safely; but it will not be like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton was not convinced. He said nothing
further, but late on that first night he made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
the attempt alone. The others were asleep,
and suspected nothing until the morning.
Then Father Claude, who came and went freely
among the Indians, brought word that he had
been caught a league to the north. The Indians
bound him, and tied him to stakes in a strongly
guarded hut. This much the priest learned
from Tegakwita, the warrior who had guarded
them on the night of their capture. After Menard&#8217;s
appeal to his gratitude he had shown a
willingness to be friendly, and, though he
dared do little openly, he had given the captives
many a comfort on the hard journey
southward.</p>
<p>Later in the morning Menard and Mademoiselle
St. Denis were sitting at the door of their
hut. The irregular street was quiet, excepting
for here and there a group of naked children
playing, or a squaw passing with a load of firewood
on her back. An Indian girl came in
from the woods toward them. She was of
light, strong figure, with a full face and long
hair, which was held back from her face by
bright ribbons. Her dress showed more than
one sign of Mission life. She was cleaner than
most of the Indians, and was not unattractive.
She came to them without hesitation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am Tegakwita&#8217;s sister. My name is
Mary; the Fathers at the Mission gave it to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard hardly gave her a glance, but Mademoiselle
was interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not your Indian name?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&ndash;&ndash;Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you never have another?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My other name is forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These Mission girls like to ape our ways,&#8221;
said Menard, in French.</p>
<p>The girl looked curiously at them, then she
untied a fold of her skirt, and showed a heap of
strawberries. &#8220;For the white man&#8217;s squaw,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle blushed and laughed. &#8220;Thank
you,&#8221; she replied, holding out her hands. The
girl gave her the berries, and turned away.
Menard looked up as a thought came to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Mary. Do you know where the
young white chief is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He tried to run away. He cannot
run away from our warriors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you afraid to go to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother, Tegakwita, is guarding him.
I am not afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard went to a young birch tree that stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
near the hut, peeled off a strip of bark, and
wrote on it:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you try to escape again you will endanger
my plans. Keep your patience, and I can
save you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you take him some berries, and give
him this charm with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the note, rolled it up with a nod,
and went away. Menard saw the question in
Mademoiselle&#8217;s eyes, and said: &#8220;It was a warning
to be cool. Our hope is in getting the
good-will of the chiefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will they&ndash;&ndash;will they hurt him, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not. At least we are still alive and
safe; and years ago, Mademoiselle, I learned
how much that means.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid looked into the trees without replying.
Her face had lost much of its fulness,
and only the heavy tan concealed the worn outlines.
But her eyes were still bright, and her
spirit, now that the first shock had passed, was
firm.</p>
<p>Father Claude returned, after a time, with a
heavy face. He drew Menard into the hut, and
told him what he had gathered: that the Long
Arrow and his followers were planning a final
vengeance against Captain Menard. All the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
braves knew of it; everywhere they were talking
of it, and preparing for the feasting and
dancing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will wait until after the fighting, won&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu. It is planned to begin soon,
within a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you inquired for the Big Throat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is five leagues away, at the next village.
We can hardly hope for help from him, I fear.
All the tribes are preparing to join in fighting
our troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard paused to think.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks bad, Father.&#8221; He walked up and
down the hut. &#8220;The Governor&#8217;s column must
have followed up the river within a few days of
us. Then much time was lost in getting us
down here.&#8221; He turned almost fiercely to the
priest. &#8220;Why, the campaign may have opened
already. Word may come to-morrow from the
Senecas calling out the Onondagas and Cayugas.
Do you know what that means? It
means that I have failed,&ndash;&ndash;for the first time in
my life, Father,&ndash;&ndash;miserably failed. There must
be some way out. If I could only get word to
the Big Throat. I&#8217;m certain I could talk him
over. I have done it before.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>Father Claude had never before seen despair
in Menard&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak well, M&#8217;sieu. There must be
some way. God is with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Captain was again pacing the beaten
floor. Finally he came to the priest, and took
his arm. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it is that gives
me courage, Father, but at my age a man isn&#8217;t
ready to give up. They may kill me, if they
like, but not before I&#8217;ve carried out my orders.
The Onondagas must not join the Senecas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;began the priest.</p>
<p>Menard shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet,&ndash;&ndash;but
we can do it.&#8221; He went out of doors,
as if the sunlight could help him, and during
the rest of the day and evening he roamed
about or lay motionless under the trees. The
maid watched him until dark, but kept silent;
for Father Claude had told her, and she, too,
believed that he would find a way.</p>
<p>Late in the evening Father Claude began to
feel disturbed. Menard was still somewhere
off among the trees. He had come in for his
handful of grain, at the supper hour, but with
hardly a word. The Father had never succeeded,
save on that one occasion when Danton
was the subject, in carrying on a long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
conversation with the maid; and now after a
few sorry attempts he went out of doors. He
thought of going to the Captain, to cheer his
soul and prepare his mind for whatever fate
awaited him, but his better judgment held
him back.</p>
<p>The village had no surface excitement to
suggest coming butchery and war. The children
were either asleep or playing in the open.
Warriors walked slowly about, wrapped closely
in blankets, though the night was warm. The
gnats and mosquitoes were humming lazily, the
trees barely stirring, and the voices of gossiping
squaws or merry youths blended into a low
drone. There was the smell in the air of wood
and leaves burning, from a hundred smouldering
fires. Father Claude stood for a long time
gazing at the row of huts, and wondering that
such an air of peace and happiness could hover
over a den of brute savages, who were even at
the moment planning to torture to his death
one of the bravest sons of New France.</p>
<p>While he meditated, he was half conscious of
voices near at hand. He gave it no attention
until his quick ear caught a French word. He
started, and hurried to the hut, pausing in the
door. By the dim light of the fire, that burned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
each night in the centre of the floor, he could
see Mademoiselle standing against the wall,
with hands clasped and lips parted. Nearer,
with his back to the door, stood an Indian.</p>
<p>The maid saw the Father, but did not speak.
He came forward into the hut, and gently
touched the Indian&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked in Iroquois.</p>
<p>The Indian stood, without a reply, until the
silence grew heavy. Mademoiselle had straightened
up, and was watching with fascinated eyes.
Then, slowly, the warrior turned, and beneath
buckskin and feathers, dirt and smeared colours,
the priest recognized Danton. He turned sadly
to the maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She put her hands before her eyes. &#8220;I cannot
talk to him,&#8221; she said, in a broken voice.
&#8220;Why does he come? Why must I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Then
she collected herself, and came forward. Pity
and dignity were in her voice. &#8220;I am sorry,
Lieutenant Danton. I am very sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy choked, and Father Claude drew
him, unresisting, outside the hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come here, Danton? Tell
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton looked at him defiantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean? Where did you get
these clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It matters not where I got them. It is my
affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who gave you these clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is enough that I have friends, if those
whom I thought friends will not aid me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest was pained by the boy&#8217;s rough
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for this, my son,&ndash;&ndash;for this
strange disorder. Did you not receive a message
from your Captain?&#8221;</p>
<p>Danton hesitated. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;I received a message,&ndash;&ndash;an order to lie quiet,
and let these red beasts burn me to death.
Menard is a fool. Does he not know that they
will kill him? Does he not know that this is
his only chance to escape? He is a fool, I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget, my son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I do? Must I stay here for the
torture because my Captain commands? Why
do you hold me here? Let me go. They will
be after me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Danton. What have you said to
Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy looked at him, and for a moment
could not speak.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you, too, throw that at me, Father? It
was all I could do. I thought she cared for
her life more than for&ndash;&ndash;for Menard. No, let
me go on. I have risked everything to come
for her, and she&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;I did not know it
would be like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do you plan?&#8221; The priest&#8217;s voice
was more gentle. &#8220;Where are you going?
You cannot get to Frontenac alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Danton wearily,
turning away. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care now. I may as
well go to the devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word of farewell he walked boldly
off through the trees, drawing his blanket
about his shoulders. Father Claude stood
watching him, half in mind to call Menard,
then hesitating. Already the boy was committed:
he had broken his bonds, and to make
any effort to hold him meant certain death for
him. Perhaps it was better that he should take
the only chance left to him. The hut was
silent. He looked within, and saw the maid
still standing by the wall. Her eyes were on
him, but she said nothing, and he turned away.
He walked slowly up and down under the
great elms that arched far up over his head.
At last he looked about for the Captain, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
finding him some little way back in the woods,
told him the story.</p>
<p>Menard&#8217;s face had aged during the day.
His eyes had a dull firmness in place of the old
flash. He heard the account without a word,
and, at the close, when the priest looked at
him questioningly for a reply, he shook his
head sadly. His experiment with Danton had
failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t tell you who had helped him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu. It is very strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Menard, &#8220;it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The night passed without further incident.
Early in the morning, Father Claude went out
to find Tegakwita, and learn what news had
come in during the night of the French
column. Runners were employed in passing
daily between the different villages, keeping
each tribe fully informed.</p>
<p>Menard sat before the hut. The clearing
showed more life than on the preceding day.
Bands of warriors, hunting and scouting parties,
were coming in at short intervals, scattering to
their shelters or hurrying to the long building
in the centre of the village. The growing
boys and younger warriors ran about, calling to
one another in eager, excited voices. As the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
morning wore along, grave chiefs and braves,
wrapped in their blankets, walked by on their
way to the council house.</p>
<p>The maid, after Father Claude had gone,
watched the Captain for a long time through
the open door. The conversation with the
Long Arrow, on the night of their capture, had
been burned into her memory; and now, as
she looked at Menard&#8217;s drawn face and weary
eyes, the picture came to her again of the Long
Arrow sitting by the river in the dim light of
the stars,&ndash;&ndash;and of the white man who had
fought for her, lying before him, gazing upward
and speaking with a calm voice to the stern
chief who wished to kill him. Then, in spite
of the excitement, the danger, and exhaustion
of the fight, it had seemed that the Captain
could not long be held by this savage. His
stern manner, his command, had given her a
confidence which had, until this moment,
strengthened her. But now, of a sudden, she
saw in his eyes the look of a man who sees
no way ahead. This quarrel with the Long
Arrow was no matter of open warfare, even of
race against race; it was an eye for an eye, the
demand of a crazed father for the life of the
slayer of his son. That she could do nothing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
that she must sit feebly while he went to his
death, came to her with a dead sense of pain.</p>
<p>With a restless spirit she went out of doors,
passing him with a little smile; but he did not
look up. A group of passing youths stopped
and jeered at him, but he did not give them a
glance. She shrank back against the building
until they had gone on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not mind them, Mademoiselle,&#8221; said
Menard, quietly. &#8220;They will not harm you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated by his side, half in mind to
speak to him, to tell him that she knew his
trouble, and had faith in him, but his bowed
head was forbidding in its solitude. All about
the hut, under the spreading trees, was a stretch
of coarse green sod, dotted with tiny yellow
flowers and black-centred daisies. She wandered
over the grass, gathering them until her
hands were full. Two red boys came by, and
paused to cry at her, taunting her as if she, too,
were to meet the fate of a war captive. The
thought made her shudder, but then, on an
impulse, she called to them in their own language.
They looked at each other in surprise.
She walked toward them, laying down the
flowers, and holding out her hand. A little
later, when Menard looked up, he saw her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
sitting beneath a gnarled oak, a boy on either
side eagerly watching her. She was talking
and laughing with them, and teaching them to
make a screeching pipe with grass-blades held
between the thumbs. He envied her her elastic
spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have made two friends,&#8221; he called in
French.</p>
<p>She looked up and nodded, laughing. &#8220;They
are learning to make the music of the white
brothers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys&#8217; faces had sobered at the sound of
his voice. They looked at him doubtfully, and
then at each other. He got up and walked
slowly toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will make friends, too, Mademoiselle,&#8221; he
said, smiling. &#8220;We have none too many here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he had taken a dozen steps, the boys
arose. He held out his hands, saying, &#8220;Your
father would be friends with his children.&#8221; But
they began to retreat, a step at a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, my children,&#8221; said the maid, smiling
at the words as she uttered them. &#8220;The white
father is good. He will not hurt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They kept stepping backward until he had
reached the maid&#8217;s side; then, with a shout of
defiance, they scampered away. In the distance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
they stopped, and soon were the centre of
a group of children whom they taught to blow
on the grass-blades, with many a half-frightened
glance toward Menard and the maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, at length, &#8220;you may see
the advantage of a reputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, and, moved by the pathos
underlying the words, could not, for the moment,
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I once had a home in this village,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;It stood over there, in the bare spot
near the beech tree.&#8221; His eyes rested on the
spot for a moment, then he turned back to the
hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; she said shyly.</p>
<p>The little heap of flowers lay where she had
dropped them; and, taking them up, she arranged
them hastily and held them out. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
take them?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her, a little surprised, then held
out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&ndash;&ndash;thank you. I don&#8217;t know what I
can do with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked back together.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must wear some of the daisies, Mademoiselle.
They will look well.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked down at her torn, stained dress,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
and laughed softly; but took the white cluster
he gave her, and thrust the stems through a
tattered bit of lace on her breast.</p>
<p>Menard was plainly relieved by the incident.
He had been worn near to despair, facing a
difficulty which seemed every moment farther
from a solution; and now he turned to her
fresh, light mood as to a refuge.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must put these in water, Mademoiselle,
or they will soon lose their bloom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had a cup&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A cup? A woodsman would laugh at your
question. There is the spring, here is the
birch; what more could you have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will make a cup,&ndash;&ndash;if you will hold the
flowers. They are beautiful, Mademoiselle.
No nation has such hills and lakes and flowers
as the Iroquois. The Hurons boast of their
lake country,&ndash;&ndash;and the Sacs and Foxes, too,
though they have a duller eye for the picturesque.
See&ndash;&ndash;the valley yonder&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He pointed
through a rift in the foliage to the league-long
glimpse of green, bound in by the gentle hills
that rose beyond&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;even to the tired old
soldier there is nothing more beautiful, more
peaceful.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>He peeled a long strip of bark from the birch
tree, and rolled it into a cup. &#8220;Your needle
and thread, Mademoiselle,&ndash;&ndash;if they have not
taken them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I have everything here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She got her needle, and under his direction
stitched the edges of the bark.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it will leak, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;The tree is the Indian&#8217;s
friend, Mademoiselle. Now it is a pine tree
that we need. The guards will tell me of one.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked over to the little group of warriors
still at their game of platter,&ndash;&ndash;the one
never-ceasing recreation of the Onondagas, at
which they would one day gamble away
blankets, furs, homes, even squaws, only to
win them back on the next. They looked at
him suspiciously when he questioned them;
but he was now as light of heart as on the day,
a few weeks earlier, when he had leaned on the
balcony of the citadel at Quebec, idly watching
the river. He smiled at them, and after a
parley the maid saw one tall brave point to a
tree a few yards farther in the wood. They
followed him closely with their eyes until he
was back within the space allowed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mademoiselle, we can gum the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
seams,&ndash;&ndash;see? It is so easy. The cold water will
harden it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went together to the spring and filled
the cup, first drinking each a draught. He
rolled a large stone to the hut door, and set
the cup on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mademoiselle, it will not stand. I am
not a good workman, I fear. But then, it is
not often in a woodsman&#8217;s life that he keeps
flowers at his door. We must have some
smaller stones to prop it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will get them, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221; In spite of his
protests she ran out to the path and brought
some pebbles. &#8220;Now we have decorated our
home.&#8221; She sat upon the ground, leaning
against the log wall, and smiling up at him.
&#8220;Sit down, M&#8217;sieu. I am tired of being solemn,
we have been solemn so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already the heaviness was coming back on
the Captain. He wondered, as he looked at
her, if she knew how serious their situation was.
It hardly seemed that she could understand it,
her gay mood was so genuine. She glanced up
again, and at the sight of the settling lines
about his mouth and the fading sparkle in his
eyes, her own eyes, while the smile still hovered,
grew moist.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she said softly,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;very, very
sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat near by, and fingered the flowers in
the birch cup. They were both silent. Finally
she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that you think that&ndash;&ndash;that I do
not understand. It is not that, M&#8217;sieu. But
when I think about it, and the sadness comes,
I know, some way, that it is going to come out
all right. We are prisoners, but other people
have been prisoners, too. I have heard of many
of them from Father Dumont. He himself
has suffered among the Oneidas. I&ndash;&ndash;I cannot
believe it, even when it seems the darkest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you are right, Mademoiselle. I, too,
have felt that there must be a way. And at the
worst, they will not dare to hurt Father Claude
and&ndash;&ndash;you.&#8221; And under his breath he added,
&#8220;Thank God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will not dare to hurt you, M&#8217;sieu.
They must not do it.&#8221; She rose and stood
before him. &#8220;When I think of that,&ndash;&ndash;that you,
who have done so much that I might be safe,
are in danger, I feel that it would be cowardly
for me to go away without you. You would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
not have left me, on the river. I know you
would have died without a thought. And I&ndash;&ndash;if
anything should happen, M&#8217;sieu; if Father
Claude and I should be set free, and&ndash;&ndash;without
you&ndash;&ndash;I could never put it from my thoughts.
I should always feel that I&ndash;&ndash;that you&ndash;&ndash;no no,
M&#8217;sieu. They cannot do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook away a tear, and looked at him
with an honest, fearless gaze. It was the outpouring
of a grateful heart, true because she
herself was true, because she could not accept
his care and sacrifice without a thought of what
she owed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;that it was
not your fault. They could have caught me as
easily if you had not been there. It is a soldier&#8217;s
chance, Mademoiselle. He must take
what life brings, with no complaint. It is the
young man&#8217;s mistake to be restless, impatient.
For the rest of us, why, it is our life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, M&#8217;sieu, you are not discouraged?
You have not given up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have not given up.&#8221; He rose and
looked into her eyes. &#8220;I have come through
before; I may again. If I am not to get through,
I shall fight them till I drop. And then, I pray
God, I may die like a soldier.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>He turned away and went into the hut.
He was in the hardest moment of his trial. It
was the inability to fight, the lack of freedom,
of weapons, the sense of helplessness, that had
come nearer to demoralizing Menard than a
hundred battles. He had been trusted with
the life of a maid, and, more important still,
with the Governor&#8217;s orders. He was, it seemed,
to fail.</p>
<p>The maid stood looking after him. She
heard him drop to the ground within. Then
she roamed aimlessly about, near the building.</p>
<p>Father Claude came up the path, walking
slowly and wearily, and entered the hut. A
moment later Menard appeared in the doorway
and called:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle.&#8221; As she approached, he
said gravely, &#8220;I should like it if you will
come in with us. It is right that you should
have a voice in our councils.&#8221;</p>
<p>She followed him in, wondering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father Claude has news,&#8221; Menard said.</p>
<p>The priest told them all that he had been
able to learn. Runners had been coming in
during the night at intervals of a few hours.
They brought word of the landing of the French
column at La Famine. The troops had started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
inland toward the Seneca villages. The Senecas
were planning an ambush, and meanwhile
had sent frantic messages to the other tribes
for aid. The Cayuga chiefs were already on
the way to meet in council with the Onondagas.
The chance that the attack might be aimed
only at the Senecas, to punish them for
their depredations of the year before, had given
rise to a peace sentiment among the more prudent
Onondagas and Cayugas, who feared the
destruction of their fields and villages. Up to
the present, none had known where the French
would strike. But, nevertheless, said the
priest, the general opinion was favourable to
taking up the quarrel with the Senecas.</p>
<p>Further, the French were leaving a rearguard
of four hundred men in a hastily built
stockade at La Famine, and the more loose-tongued
warriors were already talking of an
attack on this force, cutting the Governor&#8217;s
communications, and then turning on him from
the rear, leaving it to the Senecas to engage
him in front.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>THE WORD OF AN ONONDAGA.</h3>
</div>
<p>For a long time after Father Claude had
finished speaking, the three sat talking over
the situation. Even the maid had suggestions.
But when all had been said, when the chances
of a rescue by the French, or of getting a hearing
before the council, even of a wild dash for
liberty, had been gone over and over, their
voices died away, and the silence was eloquent.
D&#8217;Orvilliers would know that only capture
could have prevented them from reaching the
fort; but even supposing him to believe that
they were held by the Onondagas, he had
neither the men nor the authority to fight
through the Cayuga lakes and hills to reach
them. As for the Governor&#8217;s column, it would
have its hands full before marching ten leagues
from La Famine. Had Menard been alone, he
would have made the attempt to escape, knowing
from the start that the chance was near to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
nothing, but glad of the opportunity at least to
die fighting. But with Mademoiselle to delay
their progress, and to suffer his fate if captured,
it was different. As matters stood, she was
likely to be released with Father Claude, as soon
as he should be disposed of. And so his mind
had settled on staying, and dying, if he must,
alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not known whether to tell all,&#8221; said
Father Claude, after the silence. &#8220;And yet
it would seem that Mademoiselle may as well
know the truth now as later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not told me?&#8221; she said, with reproach
in her voice. &#8220;Must I always be a
child to you, Father? If God has seen it best
to place me here, am I not to help bear the
burden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle is right, Father. Hold nothing
back. Three stout hearts are better than
two.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest looked gravely at the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;The word has gone out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
Long Arrow, by his energy and his eloquence,
but most of all because he had the courage to
capture the Big Buffalo in the enemy&#8217;s country
with but a score of braves, now controls the
village. To-morrow night the great council will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
begin. The war chiefs of all the Cayuga and
Onondaga and Oneida and Mohawk villages
will meet here and decide whether to take up
the hatchet against the white men. The Long
Arrow well knows that his power will last only
until the greater chiefs come, and he will have
his revenge before his day wanes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; asked the Captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow morning, M&#8217;sieu. The feasting
and dancing will begin to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid was looking at the priest. &#8220;I do
not understand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What will he
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He means me, Mademoiselle,&#8221; said the Captain,
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she said, &#8220;not&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;They will bring us no
food to-night. In the morning they will come
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, M&#8217;sieu, they cannot! They&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She
gazed at him, not heeding the tears that suddenly
came to her eyes and fell down upon her
cheeks; and, as she looked, she understood what
was in his mind. &#8220;Why do you not escape,
M&#8217;sieu? There is yet time,&ndash;&ndash;to-night! You
are thinking of me, and I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;Oh, I have
been selfish&ndash;&ndash;I did not know! We will stay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
here, Father Claude and I. You need not
think of us; they will not harm us&ndash;&ndash;you told
me that yourself, M&#8217;sieu. I should be in your
way, but alone&ndash;&ndash;it is so easy.&#8221; She would
have gone on, but Menard held up his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, shaking his head, &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips moved, but she saw the expression
in his eyes, and the words died. She turned to
Father Claude, but he did not look up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; said Menard, slowly,
&#8220;whether the heart of the Big Throat is still
warm toward me. He was once as my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will not be here in time,&#8221; Father
Claude said. &#8220;He does not start from his village
until the sun is dropping on the morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid could not take her eyes from
Menard&#8217;s face. Now that the final word had
come, now that all the doubts of the unsettled
day, now only half gone, had settled into a fact
to be faced, he was himself again, the quiet,
resolute soldier. Only the set, almost hard
lines about the mouth told of his suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had a friend here,&#8221; he was saying,
quietly enough, &#8220;it may be that Tegakwita&ndash;&ndash;But
no, of course not. I had forgotten about
Danton&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita has lost standing in the tribe for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
allowing Lieutenant Danton to escape. He is
very bitter, We can ask nothing from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cool air of these two men, the manner
in which they could face the prospect, coupled
with her own sense of weakness, weighed hard
upon the maid&#8217;s heart. She felt that she must
cry out, must in some manner give way to her
feelings. She rose and hurried into the open
air. The broad sunlight was still sifting down
through the leaves and lying upon the green
earth in bright patches. The robins were singing,
and many strange birds, whose calls she did
not know, but who piped gently, musically, so
in harmony with the soft landscape that their
notes seemed a part of it. It was all unreal,
this quiet, sunlit world, where the birds were
free as the air which bore their songs, while the
brave Captain&ndash;&ndash;she could not face the thought.</p>
<p>The birch cup was still on the stone by the
door. She lifted out the flowers with their
dripping stems, and rearranged them carefully,
placing a large yellow daisy in the centre.</p>
<p>An Indian was approaching up the path. He
had thrown aside his blanket, and he strode
rapidly, clad in close-fitting jacket and leggings
of deerskin, with knife and hatchet slung at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
waist. He came straight to the hut and entered,
brushing by her without a glance. Just
as he passed she recognized him. He was
Tegakwita. Her fear of these stern warriors
had suddenly gone, and she followed him into
the doorway to hear his errand. Menard
greeted him with a nod; Father Claude, too,
was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Chief, the Big Buffalo, has a
grateful heart,&#8221; said the Indian, in cutting
tones. She was glad that she could understand
him. She took a flower from the bunch
at her breast, and stood motionless in the low
doorway, pulling the petals apart, one by one
and watching the little group within. The
priest and the Captain were sitting on the
ground, Menard with his hands clasped easily
about his knees. Tegakwita stood erect, with
his back to the door. &#8220;He feels the love of a
brother for those who would make sacrifices
for him,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;It was many years
ago that he saved Tegakwita from the perils of
the hunt. Tegakwita has not forgotten. When
the White Chief became a captive, he had not
forgotten. He has lost his brave name as a
warrior because he believed in the White Chief.
He has lost&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; his voice grew tremulous with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
the emotion that lay underneath the words&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;He
has lost his sister, whom he sent to be a
sister to the white man and his squaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother speaks strangely,&#8221; said Menard,
looking up at him half suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is strange.&#8221; His voice was louder,
and in his excitement he dropped the indirect
form of speech that, in the case of an older
warrior, would have concealed his feelings. &#8220;It
is strange that you should send my sister, who
came to you in trust, to release the white brave.
It is strange you should rob me of her whom
my father placed by my side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard and Father Claude looked at each
other. The Indian watched them narrowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My son is mistaken,&#8221; said Father Claude,
quietly. &#8220;His sister has wandered away. It
may be that she has even now returned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my Father. The white brave has stolen
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard got up, and spoke with feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita does not understand. The
white brave was foolish. He is a young warrior.
He does not know the use of patience.
He first escaped against my orders. The word
I sent by your sister was a command to be
patient. He went alone, my brother. He has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
gone forever from my camp. It cannot be that
she&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo speaks lies. Who came
to cut the white brave&#8217;s bonds? Who stole the
hunting coat, the leggings of Tegakwita, that
her lover might go free? Who has dishonoured
herself, her brother, the father that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
Words failed him, and he stood facing them
with blazing eyes.</p>
<p>Menard glanced at the maid, but she had
passed the point where a shock could sway her,
and now stood quietly at the door, waiting to
hear what more the warrior would say. But he
stood motionless. Father Claude touched his
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this is true, Tegakwita, the Big Buffalo
must not be held to blame. He has spoken
truly. To talk in these words to the man who
has been your brother, is the act of a dog. You
have forgotten that the Big Buffalo never
speaks lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian gave no heed to his words. He
took a step forward, and raised his hand to his
knife. Menard smiled contemptuously, and
spread out his hands; he had no weapon. But
Tegakwita had a second thought, and dropped
his hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita, too, never speaks lies,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;He will come back before the sun has come
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked rapidly out, crowding roughly
past the maid.</p>
<p>Menajd leaned against the wall. &#8220;Poor
boy!&#8221; he said, &#8220;poor boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid came slowly in, and sat on the
rude bench which leaned against the logs near
the door. The strain of the day was drawing
out all the strength, the womanhood, that lay
behind her buoyant youth. Already the tan
was fading from her face, here in the hut and
under the protecting elms; and the whiteness
of her skin gave her, instead of a worn appearance,
the look of an older woman,&ndash;&ndash;firmer, with
greater dignity. Her eyes had a deeper, fuller
understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that there is nothing, M&#8217;sieu&ndash;&ndash;nothing
that we can do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard shook his head. &#8220;No; nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Indian,&ndash;&ndash;he says that he will come
back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t know what he means. It
doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I suppose it doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were silent for a moment. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
maid leaned forward. &#8220;What was that,
M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Loungers, on the path.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they are coming here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard rose, but she stepped to the door.
&#8220;Let me go, M&#8217;sieu. Ah, I see them. It is
my little friends.&#8221; She went out, and they
could hear her laughing with the two children,
and trying to coax them toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Danton will never get away,&#8221; said the Captain,
in a low tone to the priest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has lost his head, poor boy. I thought
him of better stuff. And the girl&ndash;&ndash;Ah, if he
had only gone alone! I could forgive his rashness,
Father, his disobedience, if only he could
go down with a clear name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still doubt,&#8221; said the priest, cautiously.
&#8220;We know only what Tegakwita
said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; Menard replied, shaking his
head, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s true. You said he wore
the hunting clothes. Some one freed him.
And the girl is gone. I wish&ndash;&ndash;Well, there is
no use. I hoped for something better, that is
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just outside the door the maid was talking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
gaily with the two children, who now and then
raised their piping voices. Then it was evident
that they were going away, for she was calling
after them. She came into the hut, smiling,
and carrying a small willow basket full of
corn.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; she said, &#8220;even now it is something
to have made a friend. We shall not go
hungry to-day, after all. Will you partake,
Father? And M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused before the Captain. He had
stepped forward, and was staring at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children? They are wandering along
the path.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Mademoiselle! Call them back.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated, in surprise; then set the basket
on the ground and obeyed. Menard paced the
floor until she returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are outside, M&#8217;sieu, too frightened to
come near.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me that birch cup, outside the door.&#8221;
He was speaking in quick, low tones. &#8220;They
must not see me. It would frighten them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She brought him the cup, and he emptied
the flowers on the floor, tearing open the
seams, and drying the wet white bark on his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
sleeve. He snatched a charred coal from the
heap of ashes in the centre of the floor, and
wrote rapidly in a strange mixture of words
and signs, &#8220;A piece of thread, Mademoiselle.
And look again&ndash;&ndash;see that they have not
gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are waiting, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rolled the bark tightly, and tied it with
the thread which she brought from her bundle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must have a present. Father Claude,
you have your bale. Find something quickly,&ndash;&ndash;something
that will please them. No, wait&ndash;&ndash;Mademoiselle,
have you a mirror? They
would run fifty leagues for a mirror.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, rummaged through her bundle,
and brought out a small glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this, Mademoiselle. Tell them to
give this letter to the Big Throat, at the next
village. They will know the way. He must
have it before the day is over. No harm can
come to them. If anyone would punish them,
the Big Throat will protect them. You must
make them do it. They cannot fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face flushed, and her eyes snapped as
she caught his nervous eagerness. Even Father
Claude had risen, and was watching him with
kindling eyes. She took the roll and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
mirror, and ran out the door. In a moment,
Menard, pacing the floor, could hear her merry
laugh, and the shrill-voiced delight of the
children over their new toy. He caught the
priest&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, we shall yet be free. Who could
fail with such a lieutenant as that maid. How
she laughs. One would think she had never a
care.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last she came back, and sank, with a
nervous, irresponsible little laugh, on the bench.
And then, for the moment, they all three
laughed together.</p>
<p>In the silence that followed, Father Claude
moved toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go out again, M&#8217;sieu. It may be
that there is further word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Father. And open your ears
for news of the poor boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest bowed, and went out. Menard
stood in the door watching him, as he walked
boldly along the path. After a little he turned.
The maid was looking at him, still flushed and
smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mademoiselle, we can take hope
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so brave, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>He smiled at her impulsiveness, and looked
at her, hardly conscious that he was causing
her to blush and lower her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so I am brave, Mademoiselle? It may
be that Major Provost and Major d&#8217;Orvilliers
will not feel so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they must, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what they will say? They
will speak with sorrow of Captain Menard, the
trusted, in whose hands Governor Denonville
placed the most important commission ever
given to a captain in New France. They will
regret that their old friend was not equal to the
test; that he&ndash;&ndash;ah, do not interrupt, Mademoiselle;
it is true&ndash;&ndash;that his failure lost a
campaign for New France. You heard Father
Claude; you know what these Indians plan to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not speak so, M&#8217;sieu. It is
wicked. He would be a coward who could
blame you. It was not your fault that you were
captured. When I return I shall go to them
and tell them how you fought, and how you
faced them like&ndash;&ndash;like a hero. When I
return&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She stopped, as if the word were
strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, Mademoiselle, and God grant that you
may return soon. But your good heart leads
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
you wrong. It was my fault that I did not bring
a force strong enough to protect myself,&ndash;&ndash;and
you. To fight is not a soldier&#8217;s first duty. It
is to be discreet; he must know when not to
fight as well as when to draw his sword; he
must know how many men are needed to defend
his cause. No; I was overconfident, and
I lost. And there we must leave it. Nothing
more can be said.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood moodily over the heap of ashes.
When he looked at her again, she had risen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The flowers, M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you&ndash;&ndash;you
threw them away.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced down. They lay at his feet.
Silently he knelt and gathered them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you help me, Mademoiselle? We will
make another cup. And these two large daisies,&ndash;&ndash;did
you see how they rested side by side
on the ground when I would have trampled on
them? You will take one and I the other; and
when this day shall be far in the past, it may be
that you will remember it, and how we two
were here together, waiting for the stroke that
should change life for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held it out, and she, with lowered eyes,
reached to take it from his hand, but suddenly
checked the motion and turned to the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you take it, Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not move; and he stood, the soldier,
helpless, waiting for a word. He had forgotten
everything,&ndash;&ndash;the low, smoke-blackened hut,
the responsibility that lay on his shoulders, the
danger of the moment,&ndash;&ndash;everything but the
slender maid who stood before him, who would
not take the flower from his hand. Then he
stepped to her side, and, taking away the other
flowers from the lace beneath her throat, he
placed the single daisy in their stead. Her
eyes were nearly closed, and she seemed hardly
to know that he was there.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it may be,&#8221; he whispered softly, &#8220;that
we, like the flowers, shall be spared.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned slowly away, and sank upon the
bench. Menard, with a strange, new lightness
in his heart, went out into the sunlight.</p>
<p>The day wore on. The warm sunbeams,
that slipped down through the foliage, lengthened
and reached farther and farther to the
east. The bright spots of light crept across
the grass, climbed the side of the hut and the
tree-trunks, lingered on the upreaching twigs,
and died away in the blue sky. The evening
star shot out its white spears, glowing and radiant,
long before the light had gone, or the purple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
and golden afterglow had faded into twilight.
Menard&#8217;s mind went back to another day, just
such a glorious, shining June day as this had
been, when he had sat not a hundred yards
from this spot, waiting, as now, for the end.
He looked at his fingers. They were scarred
and knotted; one drunken, frenzied squaw had
mangled them with her teeth. He had wondered
then how a man could endure such torture
as had come to him, and still could live
and think, could even struggle back to health.
The depression had gone from him now; his
mind was more alert than since the night of
the capture. Whether it was the bare chance
of help from the Big Throat, or the gentle sadness
in the face of the maid as she bowed her
head to the single daisy on her breast,&ndash;&ndash;something
had entered into his nerves and heart,
something hopeful and strong, He wondered,
as Father Claude came up the path, slowly,
laboriously, why the priest should be so saddened.
After all, the world was green and
bright, and life, even a few hours of it, was
sweet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What news, Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest shook his head. &#8220;Little, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the feast begun?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. They are assembling before the
Long House.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they drinking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no need for talk, and so the two
men sat before the hut, with only an idle word
now and then, until the dark came down. The
quiet of the village was broken now by the
shouts of drinking warriors, with a chanting
undertone that rose and swelled slowly into
the song that would continue, both men knew,
until the break of day, or until none was left
with sober tongue to carry the wavering air.
A great fire had been lighted, and they could
see the glare and the sparks beyond a cluster
of trees and huts. Later, straggling braves
appeared, wandering about, bottle or flask in
hand, crazed by the raw brandy with which the
English and Dutch of New York and Orange
and the French of the province alike saw fit to
keep the Indians supplied.</p>
<p>A group of the warriors came from the dance,
and staggered toward the hut of the captives.
They were armed with knives and hatchets.
One had an arquebuse, which he fired at the
trees as often as the uncertain hands of all
of them could load it. He caught sight of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
white men sitting in the shadow, and came
toward them, his fellows at his heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Move nearer the door,&#8221; whispered Menard.
&#8220;They must not get in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two edged along the ground without
rising, until they sat with their backs in the
open doorway. The Indians hung about, a few
yards away, jeering and shouting. The one
with the arquebuse evidently wished to shoot,
but the others were holding his arms, and
reasoning in thick voices. No construction of
the Iroquois traditions could make it right to
kill a prisoner who was held for the torture.</p>
<p>The white men watched them quietly. Menard
heard a rustle, and the sound of a quick
breath behind him, and he said, without taking
his eyes from the Indians:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Step back, Mademoiselle, behind the wall.
You must not stand here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The warrior broke away from the hands that
held him, staggering a rod across the grass
before he could recover his balance. The
others went after him, but he quickly rested the
piece and fired. The ball went over their
heads through the doorway, striking with a low
noise against the rear wall. Menard rose,
jerking away from the priest&#8217;s restraining hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are not hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; He stood glaring at the
huddled band of warriors, who were trying to
reload the arquebuse; then he bounded forward,
broke into the group with a force that sent two
to the ground, snatched the weapon, and, with
a quick motion, drew out the flint. He threw
the gun on the ground, and walked back to his
seat.</p>
<p>Two of the guards came running forward.
They had not been drinking, and one of them
ordered the loafers away. This did not strike
them amiss. They started off, trying to reload
as they walked, evidently not missing the flint.</p>
<p>The maid came again to the doorway, and
asked timidly:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there danger for you, M&#8217;sieu? Will
they come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It is merely a lot of drunken youths.
They have probably forgotten by now. Can
you sleep, Mademoiselle?&ndash;&ndash;have you tried?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&ndash;&ndash;I fear that I could not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be well to make the effort,&#8221; he
said gently, looking over his shoulder at her as
she leaned against the doorpost. &#8220;We do not
know what may happen. At any rate, even if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
you escape, you will need all your strength on
the morrow. A fallen captain may not command,
Mademoiselle, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is your command, M&#8217;sieu, I will try.
Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long stillness, broken only by
the distant noises of the dance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, too, will sleep, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221; said Father
Claude. &#8220;I will watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg it of you. At the least you will let
me divide the night with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall see, we shall see. There is much to
be said before either of us closes his eyes.
Hello, here is a runner.&#8221;</p>
<p>An Indian was loping up the path. He
turned in toward the hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quiet,&#8221; said the priest. &#8220;It is Tegakwita.&#8221;</p>
<p>The warrior had run a long way. He was
breathing deeply, and the sweat stood out on
his face and caught the shine of the firelight.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother has been far,&#8221; said Menard,
rising.</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Chief is not surprised? He
heard the word of Tegakwita, that he would
return before another sun. He has indeed
been far. He has followed the track of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
forest wolf that stole the child of the Onondagas.
He has found the bold, the brave white
warrior, who stole away in the night, robbing
Tegakwita of what is dearer to him than the
beating of his heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid stood again in the doorway, resting
a hand on the post, and leaning forward with
startled eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has found&ndash;&ndash;he has found him&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she
faltered.</p>
<p>The Indian did not look at her. He drew
something from the breast of his shirt, and
threw it on the ground at Menard&#8217;s feet. Then,
with broken-hearted dignity, he strode away
and disappeared in the night.</p>
<p>Father Claude stooped, and picked up the
object. Dimly in the firelight they could see
it,&ndash;&ndash;two warm human scalps, the one of brown
hair knotted to the other of black. Menard
took them in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor boy!&#8221; he said, over and over. &#8220;Poor
boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked toward the door, but the maid
had gone inside.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>A NIGHT COUNCIL.</h3>
</div>
<p>The night crept by, as had the day, wearily.</p>
<p>The two men sat in the doorway or
walked slowly back and forth across the front
of the hut, saying little. The Captain was calling
to mind every incident of their capture, and
of the original trouble between La Grange and
the hunting party. He went over the conversation
with Major Provost at Quebec word by
word, until he felt sure in his authority as the
Governor&#8217;s representative; although the written
orders in the leather bag that hung from
his neck were concerned only with his duties
in preparing Fort Frontenac for the advancing
column,&ndash;&ndash;duties that he had not fulfilled.</p>
<p>A plan was forming in his mind which would
make strong demands on the good faith of
Major Provost and the Governor. He knew,
as every old soldier knows, that governments
and rulers are thankless, that even written authority
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
is none too binding, if to make it good
should inconvenience those who so easily give
it. He knew further that if he should succeed
now in staying the Onondagas and Cayugas by
pledges which, perchance, it might not please
Governor Denonville to observe, the last frail
ties that held the Iroquois to the French would
be broken, and England would reign from the
Hudson to the river of the Illinois. And he
sighed, as he had sighed many times before, for
the old days under Frontenac, under the only
Governor of New France who could hold these
slippery redskins to their obligations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;I begin to see a
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Throat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must help, though to tell the truth I
fear that he will be of little service. He may
come in time to give us a stay; but, chief
though he is, he will hardly dare overrule
the Long Arrow on a matter so personal as
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the Long Arrow&#8217;s family&ndash;&ndash;the
Beaver?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, M&#8217;sieu, that is the least of the eight
families. If it were the Tortoise or the Bear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
against us, we should have greater cause for
fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, Father, but to each family belongs
its own quarrels, its own revenge. If the Big
Throat should interfere too deeply, it would
anger the other small families, who might fear
the same treatment at some other time. And
with Beaver, Snipe, Deer, and Potato united
against us,&ndash;&ndash;well, it is a simple enough problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were walking by the door, and Menard,
as he spoke, sat on the stone which he had
rolled there in the afternoon. The priest stood
before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we may succeed, my son. I have
seen this anger before, and it has always ended
in the one way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; the Captain replied, &#8220;it does depend
on the Big Throat. He must reach here
in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God grant that he may!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, Father, I look for a delay.
Unless his heart has hardened rapidly, he still
thinks of me. Together we will go to him,
and ask a hearing in the war council.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oratory will not release us, I fear, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall not ask to be released, Father.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
Don&#8217;t you understand? It is more than that
we shall demand,&ndash;&ndash;it is peace with New
France, the safety of the column&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest&#8217;s eyes lighted. &#8220;Do you think,
M&#8217;sieu&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do it. They have not heard all
the truth. They do not want a long war which
will kill their braves and destroy their homes
and their corn. It is this attack on the Senecas
that has drawn them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will tell them that the Governor fights
only the Senecas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than that. The La Grange affair has
stirred them up. It has weakened their faith
in the Governor,&ndash;&ndash;it has as good as undone
all the work of twenty years past. Our only
hope is to reestablish that faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that we may,&#8221; said the priest, slowly.
&#8220;But they have reached a state now where
words alone will hardly suffice. I have tried
it, M&#8217;sieu. Since we came, I have talked and
reasoned with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Father, I am going to try it. The
question is, will the Governor make good what
I shall have to promise? It may be that he
will. If not,&ndash;&ndash;then my life will not be worth
a box of tinder if I stray a league from Quebec
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
without a guard.&#8221; He looked down at the
daisy on his coat. &#8220;But the maid will be safe,
Father. She will be safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe that they would harm her,
even as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I trust not&ndash;&ndash;I trust not. But we are
here, and she is here; and not until I know
that her journey is over will my eyes close
easily at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your plan, M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;you have not
told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I thought you understood. Did you
know about the capture at Frontenac when it
happened? No? It was like this. The Governor
sent word, with the orders that came up
to the fort in May, that at the first sign of
trouble or disturbance with the Indians there,
d&#8217;Orvilliers should seize a few score of them
and send them down the river in chains. It
would be an example, he said. I was awaiting
orders,&ndash;&ndash;I had just returned from the Huron
Country and Michillimackinac,&ndash;&ndash;and d&#8217;Orvilliers
called me to his rooms and showed me the
order. &#8216;Now,&#8217; he said, &#8216;who in the devil is
meddling at Quebec?&#8217; I did not know; I do
not know yet. But there was the order. He
turned it over to La Grange, with instructions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
to wait until some offence should give him an
excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the rest, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. You have heard a dozen times,&ndash;&ndash;how
La Grange was drinking, and how he
lied to a peaceful hunting party, and drugged
them, and brained one poor devil with his own
sword. And what could we do, Father? Right
or wrong, the capture was made. It was too
late to release them, for the harm was done.
If d&#8217;Orvilliers had refused to carry out his
orders and send them to Quebec, it would have
cost him his commission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the only officer on detached service
at the Fort. D&#8217;Orvilliers could not look me
in the face when he ordered me to take them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will tell them this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This? Yes, and more. I will pledge the
honour of New France that La Grange shall
suffer. The man who has betrayed the Onondagas
must be punished before we can have
their good faith. Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude walked away a few steps, and
then back, his hands clasped before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand, Father? If a wrong
has been done an Iroquois, it is revenge that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
will appease him. Very well. Captain la
Grange has wronged them; let them have
their revenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the right view, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for us, Father,&ndash;&ndash;for you and me. To
us it is simple justice. But justice,&ndash;&ndash;that is
not the word with which to reach an Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it may be that Captain la Grange is
in favour at Quebec. What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not seem to understand me yet,
Father.&#8221; Menard spoke slowly and calmly.
&#8220;This is not my quarrel. I can take what my
life brings, and thank your God, the while,
that I have life at all. But if by one foolish
act the Iroquois are to be lost to France, while
I have the word on my tongue that will set
all right, am I,&ndash;&ndash;well, would you have me such
a soldier?&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest was looking through the leaves
at the firelight. For once he seemed to have
nothing to offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will not be easy, Father; but when was
a soldier&#8217;s work easy? First I must make
these Indians believe me,&ndash;&ndash;and you know
how hard that will be. Then I must convince
Governor Denonville that this is his only
course; and that will be still harder. Or, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
they will not release me, you will be my messenger,
Father, and take the word. I will
stay here until La Grange has got his dues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us suppose,&#8221; said the priest,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;let us
suppose that you did not do this, that you did
not take this course against Captain la Grange
which will leave him a marked man to the Iroquois,
even if the Governor should do nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Menard, &#8220;the rear-guard at La
Famine will be butchered, and the army of
New France will be cut to pieces. That is
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It points that way, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us take another case. Suppose
that you succeed at the council, that you are
released. Then if the Governor should disclaim
responsibility, should&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Father, I will go to La Grange and
make him fight me. I mean to pledge my
word to these chiefs. You know what that
means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the priest, &#8220;yes.&#8221; He seemed
puzzled and unsettled by some thought that
held his mind. He walked slowly about, looking
at the ground. Menard, too, was restless.
He rose from the stone and tossed away the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
pebbles that had supported the cup, one at a
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are singing again,&#8221; he said, listening
to the droning chant that came indistinctly
through the dark. &#8220;One would think they
would long ago have been too drunk to stand.
How some of these recruits the King sends over
to us would envy them their stomachs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest made no reply. He did not understand
the impulse that led the Captain to speak
irrelevantly at such a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the doctors are dancing now,&#8221;
Menard continued. &#8220;It may be that they will
come here. If they do, we shall have a night
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will hope not, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they should, Father,&ndash;&ndash;well, it is hard to
know just what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were thinking&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was wondering. If they come here,
and let their wild talk run away with them, it
might be well to fight them off until morning.
Maybe we could do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it might seem best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if&ndash;&ndash;if the Big Throat should not come,
or should have changed, then it would have been
better that I had submitted.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are thinking of me, my son. You
must not. I will not leave you to go without
a struggle. I can fight, if needs be, as well as
you. I will do my part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not that, Father. But if we fight, and
the Big Throat does not come,&ndash;&ndash;there is the
maid. They would not spare her then.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest looked at the Captain, and in the
dim, uncertain light he saw something of the
thought that lay behind those wearied eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; he said; &#8220;true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard walked up and down, a half-dozen
steps forward, a half-dozen back, without a
glance at the priest, who watched him closely.
Suddenly he turned, and the words that were
in his mind slipped unguarded from his tongue,
low and stern:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they come, Father,&ndash;&ndash;if they harm her,&ndash;&ndash;God!
if they even wake her, I will kill them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude looked at him, but said nothing.
They walked together up and down; then,
as if weary, they sat again by the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some things which I could not
talk over with you,&#8221; said the priest, finally. &#8220;It
was best that I should not. And now I hardly
know what is the right thing for me to do, or
to say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What troubles you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are cooler, it will come to you.
For to-night,&ndash;&ndash;until our last moment of choice,&ndash;&ndash;I
must ask one favour, M&#8217;sieu. You will not
decide on this course until it comes to the end.
You will think of other ways; you will&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else have I been doing, Father?
There is no other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will not decide yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. We need not, to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest seemed relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; came in a low voice from the darkness
within the hut, &#8220;may I not sit with
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are awake, Mademoiselle? You have
not been sleeping?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I could not. I&ndash;&ndash;I have not heard you,
M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;I have not listened. But I wanted
to very much. I have only my thoughts, and
they are not the best of company to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come.&#8221; Menard rose and got one of the
priest&#8217;s blankets, folding it and laying it on the
ground against the wall. &#8220;I fear that we may
be no better than the thoughts; but such as we
are, we are at the service of Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat by them, and leaned back, letting her
hands fall into her lap. Menard was half in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
shadow, and he could let his eyes linger on her
face. It was a sad face now, worn by the haunting
fears that the night had brought,&ndash;&ndash;fears that
had not held their substance in the sunlight;
but the eyes were still bright. Even at this
moment she had not forgotten to catch up
the masses of hair that were struggling to be
free; and there was a touch of neatness about
her torn dress that the hardships of the journey
and the dirt and discomforts of an Indian shelter
had not been able to take away. They all three
sat without talking, watching the sparks from
the fire and the tips of flame that now and then
reached above the huts.</p>
<p>&#8220;How strange their song is, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. They will keep it up all night. If we
were nearer, you would see that as soon as a
brave is exhausted with the dancing and singing,
another will rush in to take his place.
Sometimes they fall fainting, and do not recover
for hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a dance once, at home. The Ottawas&ndash;&ndash;there
were but a few of them&ndash;&ndash;had a war-dance.
It seemed to be just for amusement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They enjoy it. It is not uncommon for
them to dance for a day when there is no hunt
to occupy them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>Father Claude had been silent. Now he rose
and walked slowly away, leaving them to talk
together. They could see him moving about
with bowed head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Father is sad, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But it is not for himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he fear now? Does he not think
that the Big Throat will come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he will come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid looked down at her clasped hands.
Menard watched her,&ndash;&ndash;the firelight was dancing
on her face and hair,&ndash;&ndash;and again the danger
seemed to slip away, the chant and the fire
to be a part of some mad dream that had carried
him in a second from Quebec to this deep-shadowed
spot, and had set this maid before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wearing the daisy, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up, half-startled at the change in
his voice. Then her eyes dropped again.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;so am I. Is it not
strange that we should be here, you and I.
And yet, when I first saw you, I thought&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard laughed gently. &#8220;I could not tell
you, without telling you what I think now, and
that would&ndash;&ndash;be&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>He spoke half playfully, and waited; but she
did not reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know what it is that has come to
me. It is not like me. Or it may be that the
soldier, all these years, has not been me. Would
it not be strange if I were but now to find myself,&ndash;&ndash;or
if you were to find me, Mademoiselle?
If it is true, if this is what I have waited so
long to find, it would be many years before I
could repay you for bringing it to me,&ndash;&ndash;it
would be a long lifetime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he waited, and still she was silent.
Then he talked on, as madly now as on the
night of their capture, when he had fought,
shouting, musket and knife in hand, at the
water&#8217;s edge. But this was another madness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is such a simple thing. Until you came
out here under the trees my mind was racked
with the troubles about us. But now you are
here, and I do not care,&ndash;&ndash;no, not if this
were to be my last night, if to-morrow they
should&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She made a nervous gesture, but
he went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see it is you, Mademoiselle, who come
into my life, and then all the rest goes out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said brokenly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude came slowly toward them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you are not too
wearied, I wish to talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose with an air of relief and joined him.
Menard watched them, puzzled. He could
hear the priest speaking in low, even tones;
and then the maid&#8217;s voice, deep with emotion.
Finally they came back, and she went
hurriedly into the hut without a glance at
the soldier, who had risen and stood by the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, M&#8217;sieu, let us walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard looked at him in surprise, but
walked with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is about the speech to the council&ndash;&ndash;and
Captain la Grange. It may be that you are
right, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right? I do not understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was but a moment ago that we talked
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have not forgotten. But what do
you mean now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You promised me to wait before deciding.
It may be that I was wrong. If you are to
make the speech, you will need to prepare it
carefully. There is none too much time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Menard. Then suddenly he
stopped and took the priest&#8217;s arm. &#8220;I did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
not think, Father; I did not understand.
What a fool I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have talked with her. He is her
cousin, and yet it did not come to me. It
will pain her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Father Claude, slowly, &#8220;it will
pain her. But I have been thinking. I fear
that you are right. It has passed beyond the
simple matter of our own lives; now it is New
France that must be thought of. You have
said that it was Captain la Grange&#8217;s treachery
that first angered the Onondagas. We must
lay this before them. If his punishment will
satisfy them, will save the rear-guard, why then,
my son, it is our duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>They paced back and forth in silence.
Menard&#8217;s heavy breathing and his quick
glances toward the hut told the priest something
of the struggle that was going on in his
mind. Suddenly he said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go to her, Father. I will tell her. I
cannot pledge myself to this act if&ndash;&ndash;if she&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu, you must not; I have told her.
She understands. And she has begged me
to ask you not to speak with her. She has a
brave heart, but she cannot see you now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She asked you,&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; said the Captain, slowly.
&#8220;She asked you&ndash;&ndash;I cannot think. I do not
know what to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest quietly walked back to the stone
by the door, and left the soldier to fight out the
battle alone. It was half an hour before he
came back and stood before Father Claude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard spoke shortly, &#8220;Yes, Father, you are
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all, but it told the priest that the
matter had been finally settled. He had seen
the look in the Captain&#8217;s eyes when the truth
had come to him; and he knew now what he had
not dreamed before, that the soldier&#8217;s heart
had gone out to this maid, and now he must
set his hand against one of her own blood.
The Father knew that he would do it, would
fight La Grange to the end. A word was trembling
on his tongue, but as he looked at the
seamed face before him, he could not bring
himself to add a deeper sorrow to that already
stamped there.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must help me with the speech, Father.
My wits are not at their best, I fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Willingly, M&#8217;sieu. And the presents,&ndash;&ndash;we
must think of that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;True. We have not the wampum collars.
It must be something of great value that will take
their place. You know how much tradition
means to these people. Of course I have nothing.
But you&ndash;&ndash;you have your bale. And Mademoiselle&ndash;&ndash;together
you should find something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear that I have little. My blankets and
my altar they would not value. One moment&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
stepped to the door, and spoke softly, &#8220;Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Father.&#8221; She stood in the doorway,
wearily. It was plain that she had been weeping,
but she was not ashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall need your help, Mademoiselle.
Anything in your bale that would please the
chiefs must be used.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the custom,&#8221; continued the priest, &#8220;at
every council. To the Indians a promise is not
given, a statement is not true, a treaty is not
binding, unless there is a present for each clause.
We have much at stake, and we must give what
we have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped back into the darkness, and they
could hear her dragging the bundle. Menard
sprang to help.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked toward the sound with his hands
spread before him. One hand rested on her
shoulder, where she stooped over the bale. She
did not shrink from his touch. For a moment
he stood, struggling with a mad impulse to take
her slender figure in his arms, to hold her where
a thousand Indians could not harm her save by
taking his own strong life; to tell her what made
this moment more to him than all the stern
years of the past. It may be that she understood,
for she was motionless, almost breathless.
But in a moment he was himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He stooped, took up the bundle, and carried
it outside. She followed to the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will look, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, and knelt by the bundle, while
the two men waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is little here, M&#8217;sieu. I brought only
what was necessary. Here is a comb. Would
that please them?&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached back to them, holding out a high
tortoise-shell comb. They took it and examined
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is beautiful,&#8221; said Menard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; my mother gave it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, Mademoiselle,&ndash;&ndash;perhaps there is
something else, something that would do as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many should you have, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five, I had planned. There will be five
words in the speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Words?&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Iroquois each argument is a &#8216;word.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have almost nothing else, not even clothing
of value. Wait&ndash;&ndash;here is a small coat of seal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Father?&#8221; asked Menard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a book with highly coloured pictures,
M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;The Ceremonies of the Mass applied
to the Passion of Our Lord.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid! Have you nothing else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard turned to the maid, who was still on
her knees by the open bundle, looking up at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that we must take your coat and
the comb,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>She answered in a low tone, but firmly: &#8220;You
know, M&#8217;sieu, that it would hurt me to do nothing.
It hurts me to do so little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mademoiselle. Well, Father,
we must use our wits. It may be that four
words will be enough, but I cannot use fewer.
We have but three presents.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the priest, &#8220;yes.&#8221; He walked
slowly by them, and about in a circle, repeating
the word. The maid leaned back and watched
him, wondering. He paused before the Captain
and seemed about to speak. Then abruptly he
went into the hut, and they could hear him
moving within. Menard and the maid looked
at each other, the soldier smiling quietly. He
understood.</p>
<p>Father Claude came out holding the portrait
of Catharine, the Lily of the Onondagas, in his
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that this could be used for the
fourth present,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Menard took it without a word, and laid it
on the ground by the fur coat. The maid
looked at it curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is a picture,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mademoiselle,&#8221; the Captain replied.
&#8220;It is the portrait of an Onondaga maiden
who is to them, and to the French, almost a
saint. They will prize this above all else.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid raised it, and looked at the
strangely clad figure. Father Claude quietly
walked away, but Menard went after and gripped
his hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>THE BIG THROAT SPEAKS.</h3>
</div>
<p>The light of the rising sun struggled through
the mist that lay on the Onondaga Valley.
The trees came slowly out of the gray air, like
ships approaching through a fog. As the sun
rose higher, each leaf glistened with dew. The
grass was wet and shining.</p>
<p>Menard had seized a few hours of sleep. He
awoke with the first beam of yellow light, and
rose from his bed on the packed, beaten ground
before the door. Father Claude was sitting on
a log, at a short distance, with bowed head.
The Captain stretched his stiff limbs, and
walked slowly about until the priest looked
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a selfish thought that led me to
choose the earlier watch. These last hours
are the best for sleeping.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have rested well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard no sound. I think that she
still sleeps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Softly, then. There has been no disturbance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None. The singing has died down during
the last hour. There, you can hear it,
M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But it is only a few voices. It must
be that the others are sleeping off the liquor.
They will soon awaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>A musket was fired, and another.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the signal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The song, which one group after another had
taken up all through the night, rose again and
grew in volume as one at a time the sleepers
aroused and joined the dance. The only sign
of the fire was a pillar of thin smoke that rolled
straight upward in the still air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Menard, &#8220;are the guards
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not seen them. I suppose they are
wandering within call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, quickly, before we are seen, help me
with this log.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Into the hut with it, and the others, there.
If a chance does come,&ndash;&ndash;well, it may be that
we shall yet be reduced to holding the hut.
These will serve to barricade the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were not disturbed while they rolled
the short logs within and piled them at one
side of the door, where they could not be seen
from the path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quietly, Father,&#8221; whispered the Captain.
He knew that the maid lay sleeping, back
among the shadows. &#8220;And the presents,&ndash;&ndash;you
have packed them away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In my bundle, M&#8217;sieu. They will not be
harmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>They returned to the open air, and looked
about anxiously for signs of a movement toward
the hut; but the irregular street was silent.
Here and there, from the opening in the roof
of some low building of bark and logs, rose a
light smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are all at the dance,&#8221; said Menard.
His memory supplied the picture: the great
fire, now sunk to heaps of gray ashes, spread
over the ground by the feet of those younger
braves who had wished to show their hardihood
by treading barefoot on the embers; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
circle of grunting figures, leaning forward,
hatchet and musket in hand, moving slowly
around the fire with a shuffling, hopping step;
the outer circle of sitting or lying figures, men,
women, and children, drunken, wanton, quarrelsome,
dreaming of the blood that should be let
before the sun had gone; and at one side the
little group of old men, beating their drums of
wood and skin with a rhythm that never slackened.</p>
<p>The song grew louder, and broke at short
intervals into shouts and cries, punctuated with
musket-shots.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are coming, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>The head of the line, still stepping in the
slow movement of the dance, appeared at some
distance up the path. The Long Arrow was
in front, in full war-paint, and wearing the collar
of wampum beads. Beside him was the
Beaver. The line advanced, two and two,
steadily toward the lodge of the white men.</p>
<p>Menard leaned against the door-post and
watched them. His figure was relaxed, his
face composed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are the doctors, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group of medicine men, wildly clad in
skins of beasts and reptiles, with the heads of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
animals on their shoulders, came running along
beside the line, leaping high in the air, and
howling.</p>
<p>Menard turned to the priest. &#8220;Father, which
shall it be,&ndash;&ndash;shall we fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know, M&#8217;sieu. We have no
weapons, and it may be, yet, that the Big
Throat&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is the maid, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time since the sunrise the quiet
expression left the Captain&#8217;s face. He was
silent for a moment. Then he said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go, Father. You must protect her.
If anything&ndash;&ndash;if they should dare to touch her,
you will&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will fight them, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; Menard held out his hand.
They gripped in silence, and turned again
toward the Indians, who were now but a hundred
yards away.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will stop in a moment,&#8221; said Menard,
&#8220;and form for the gantlet. Yes,&ndash;&ndash;see, the
Long Arrow holds up his hands.&#8221; He stood
irresolute, looking at the fantastic picture; then
he stepped back into the hut.</p>
<p>The maid lay in her blanket on the bench.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
He stood over her, looking at the peaceful face
that rested on her outstretched arm. He took
her hand, and said gently:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stirred, and slowly opened her eyes; she
did not seem surprised that he should be there
clasping tightly her slender hand. He wondered
if he had been in her dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you are going, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him with half-dazed eyes.
She was not yet fully awake.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not fear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They cannot
hurt you. You will soon be safe at&ndash;&ndash;at
Frontenac.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was beginning to understand. Then all
at once the light came into her eyes, and she
clung to his arm, which was still wet with the
dew.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not going? They will not take
you? Oh, M&#8217;sieu, I cannot&ndash;&ndash;you must not!&#8221;</p>
<p>She would have said more, but he bent down
and kissed her forehead. Then, with his free
hand he unclasped her fingers and went away.
At the door he turned. She was sitting on the
bench, gazing after him with a look that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
never forgot. For all of the unhappiness, the
agony, that came to him from those eyes, it
was with a lighter heart that he faced the
warriors who rushed to seize him.</p>
<p>Every brave, woman, and child that the village
could supply was in the double line that
stretched away from a point on the path not
a hundred yards distant to the long council
house, which stood on a slight rise of ground.
They were armed with muskets, clubs, knives,&ndash;&ndash;with
any instrument which could bruise or,
mutilate the soldier as he passed, and yet leave
life in him for the harder trials to follow. Five
warriors, muskets in hand, had come to the hut.
They sprang at Menard as he stepped out
through the doorway, striking him roughly and
holding his elbows behind his back.</p>
<p>A shout went up from the waiting lines, and
muskets and clubs were waved in the air. The
Captain stepped forward briskly with head erect,
scorning to glance at the braves who walked on
either side. He knew that they would not kill
him in the gantlet; they would save him for
the fire. He had passed through this once, he
could do it again, conscious that every moment
brought nearer the chance of a rescue by the
Big Throat. Perhaps twenty paces had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
covered, and his guardians were prodding him
and trying to force him into a run, when he
heard a shout from the priest, and then the
sounds of a struggle at the hut. He turned his
head, but a rude hand knocked it back. Again
he heard the priest&#8217;s voice, and this time, with
it, a woman&#8217;s scream.</p>
<p>The Captain hesitated for a second. The
warriors prodded him again, and before they
could raise their arms he had jerked loose,
snatched a musket from one, and swinging it
around his head, sent the two to the ground,
one with a cracked skull. Before those in the
lines could fairly see what had happened, he
was running toward the hut with two captured
muskets and a knife. In front of the hut the
three other Indians were struggling with Father
Claude, who was fighting in a frenzy, and the
maid. She was hanging back, and one redskin
had crushed her two wrists together in his hand
and was dragging her.</p>
<p>Menard was on them with a leap. They did
not see him until a musket whirled about their
ears, and one man fell, rolling, at the maid&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back into the hut!&#8221; he said roughly, and
she obeyed. As he turned to aid the priest
he called after her, &#8220;Pile up the logs, quick!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>She understood, and with the strength that
came with the moment, she dragged the logs
to the door.</p>
<p>Menard crushed down the two remaining
Indians as he would have crushed wild beasts,
without a glance toward the mob that was running
at him, without a thought for the gash in
his arm, made first by an arrow at La Gallette
and now reopened by a knife thrust. The
Father, too, was wounded, but still he could
fight. There was but a second more. The
Captain threw the four muskets into the hut,
and after them the powder-horns and bullet-pouches
which he had barely time to strip from
the dead men. Then he crowded the priest
through the opening above the logs, and came
tumbling after. Another second saw the logs
piled close against the door, while a shower of
bullets and arrows rattled against them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a musket, Father. Now, fire together!
Quick, the others! Can you load
these, Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She reached for them, and poured
the powder down the barrels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not too much, Mademoiselle. We may
run short.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>To miss a mark in that solid mob would have
been difficult. The first four shots brought
down three men, and sent another limping away
with a bleeding foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it up, Father! Don&#8217;t wait an instant.
Fast, Mademoiselle, fast! Ah, there&#8217;s one more.
See, they are falling back. Take the other wall,
Father. See that they do not come from the
rear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest ran about the hut, peering through
the chinks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see nothing,&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better stay there, then. Keep a
close watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid laid two loaded muskets at the
Captain&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we hold them off, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>His eye was pressed to an opening, and he
did not turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not, Mademoiselle. A few minutes
more may settle it. But we can give them a
fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they come again, will you let me shoot,
M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned in surprise, and looked at her
slight figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Mademoiselle?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I can help. I have shot before.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, with the excitement of the moment,
and nodded. Then they were silent. She
knelt by his side and looked through another
opening. The women and children had retreated
well up the path. The warriors were
crowded together, just out of range, talking and
shouting excitedly. A moment later a number
of these slipped to the rear and ran off between
the huts.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that mean, M&#8217;sieu? Will they
come around behind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Watch out, Father. You will hear
from them soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, M&#8217;sieu. It will be hard. There
are trees and bushes here for cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard shrugged his shoulders, and made no
reply. Time was all he wished.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Big Throat started with the first light,
he should be here before another hour,&#8221; he said
to the maid, who was watching the Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any corn in the basket, Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. I had forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall need it. Wait; I will look.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got the basket, and brought it to her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is no time for cooking, but you had better
eat what you can. And keep a close watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221; She spread her skirt, and
he poured out half of the corn.</p>
<p>&#8220;You give me too much. You must not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, and crossed to the priest, saying
over his shoulder:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle is our new recruit. And the
recruit must not complain of her food. I cannot
allow it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moments passed with no sign of action
along the line of redskins on the path. They
were quieter since the flanking party had started.
To Menard it was evident that a plan had been
settled upon. In a like position, a dozen Frenchmen
would have stormed the hut, knowing that
only two or three could fall before they were
under the shelter of the walls; but even a large
force of Indians was unwilling to take the
chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; called the Captain, &#8220;it may be better
for you to take the doorway. Mademoiselle
and I will watch the forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exchange was made rapidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you look out at the sides, as well?&#8221;
Menard said to her. &#8220;Keep moving about, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
using all the openings. There are too many
chances for approach here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I see one, shall I shoot, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;You had better tell me first.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped briskly about, peering through
the chinks with an alert eye. Menard found it
hard to keep his own watch, so eager were his
eyes to watch her. But he turned resolutely
toward the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu!&#8221; she whispered. They had been
silent for a long time. &#8220;To the left in the
bushes! It looks like a head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you make sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It is a head. May I shoot?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard nodded without looking. She rested
her musket in the opening between two logs,
and fired quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hit him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was breathless with excitement, but she
reloaded at once. A moment later Menard
fired, and then the priest.</p>
<p>&#8220;On all sides, eh?&#8221; the Captain muttered.
He called to the others: &#8220;Waste no powder.
Shoot only when you are sure of hitting. They
will fall back again. Two dead Indians will
discourage the wildest charge.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>The firing went on at intervals, but still the
warriors kept at it, creeping up from bush to
bush and tree to tree. Menard&#8217;s face grew more
serious as the time went by. He began to
realize that the Long Arrow was desperate, that
he was determined on vengeance before the
other chiefs could come. It had been a typical
savage thought that had led him to bring Menard
to this village, where he had once lived,
rather than to the one in which the chief held
greater permanent authority; the scheme was
too complete and too near its end for delay or
failure to be considered. Still the attacking
party drew nearer, swelled every moment by a
new group. Then Menard saw their object.
They would soon be near enough to dash in
close to the wall, where their very nearness
would disable the white men&#8217;s muskets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Work fast!&#8221; he said suddenly. &#8220;They
must not get nearer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; panted the maid. Her shoulder was
bruised by the heavy musket, her arms ached
with the quick ramming and lifting, but she
loaded and fired as rapidly as she could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; called the Captain. &#8220;Quick! come
here. They are too many for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest ran across the floor, half blinded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
by the smoke, cocking his musket as he came.
&#8220;Where, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&ndash;&ndash;at the oak! They are preparing
for a rush!&#8221;</p>
<p>He fired, at the last word, and one warrior
sprawled on his face. The priest followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will check them. Now back to the
door!&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude turned. The light was dim
and the smoke heavy. His eyes smarted and
blurred, so that he heard, rather than saw, the logs
come crashing back into the hut. Menard heard
it also; and together the two men dashed forward.
They met the rush of Indians with
blows that could not be stayed, but there was a
score pushing behind the few who had entered.
Slowly, the two backed across the hut. The
stock of Menard&#8217;s musket broke short off against
the head of the Beaver. His foot struck another,
and he snatched it up and fought on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; he called, &#8220;where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, M&#8217;sieu!&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice was behind him. Then he felt a
weight on his shoulder. The wearied maid, for
want of another rest for her musket, fired past
his face straight into the dark mass of Indians.
She tried to reload, but Menard was swept back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
against her. With one arm he caught and held
her tight against him, swinging the musket with
his free hand. She clung to him, hardly breathing.
They reached the rear wall. One tall
warrior bounded forward and struck the musket
from his hand. That was the end of the struggle.
They were torn apart, and dragged roughly
out into the blinding sunlight.</p>
<p>Among the Iroquois, the torture was a religious
rite, which nothing, once it was begun,
could hasten. It may have been that the
younger warriors would have rushed upon the
captives to kill them; but if so, their elders held
them back. The long lines formed again, and
the doctors ran about the little group before the
hut door, leaping and singing. Menard lay on
his face, held down by three warriors. He tried
to turn his head to see what had been done with
the maid, but could not. He would have called
to her, but to make a sound now would be to
his captors an admission of weakness.</p>
<p>A great clamour came from the lines. Menard
wondered at the delay. He heard a movement
a few yards away. Warriors were grunting,
and feet shuffled on the ground. He heard the
priest say, in a calm voice, &#8220;Courage, Mademoiselle&#8221;;
and for a moment he struggled desperately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Then, realizing his mistake, he lay quiet.
When at last he was jerked to his feet, he saw
that the priest and the maid had been forced to
take the two first places in the line. The maid
was struggling in the grasp of two braves, one
of whom made her hold a war club by closing
his own hand over hers. Menard understood;
his friends were to strike the first blows.</p>
<p>The guards tried to drag him forward, but
he went firmly with them, smiling scornfully.
There was a delay, as the line was reached, for
the maid could not be made to hold the club.
Another man dropped out of the line to aid
the two who held her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strike me, Mademoiselle,&#8221; said Menard.
&#8220;It is best.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head. Father Claude spoke:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was then that she first looked at the Captain.
When she saw the straight figure and
the set face, a sense of her own weakness came
to her, and she, too, straightened. Menard
stepped forward; and raising the club she let
it fall lightly on his shoulders. A shout went
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard, Mademoiselle, hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
must.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>She pressed her lips together, closed her
eyes, and swung the club with all her strength.
Then her muscles gave way, and she sank to
the ground, not daring to look after the Captain
as he passed on between the two rows of
savages. She heard the shouts and the wild
cries, but dimly, as if they came from far away.
The confusion grew worse, and then died
down. From screaming the voices dropped
into excited argument. She did not know
what it meant,&ndash;&ndash;not until Father Claude bent
over her and spoke gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she whispered, not looking
up. &#8220;What have they done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. The Big Throat has come.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I must go back. Take heart, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hurried away and slipped through the
crowd that had gathered about Menard and
the chief. She sat in a little heap on the
ground, not daring to feel relieved, wondering
what would come next. She could not see the
Captain, but as the other voices dropped lower
and lower, she could catch now and then a
note of his voice. In a few moments, the warriors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
who were pressing close on the outskirts
of the crowd were pushed aside, and he came
out. She looked at him, then at the ground,
shuddering, for there was blood on his forehead.
Even when he stood over her she could
not look up or speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is hope now, Mademoiselle. He is
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;Father Claude told me. Is&ndash;&ndash;are
you to be released?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly that, but we shall at least have a
little time. And I hope to get a hearing at
the council.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will let you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not asked him yet.&#8221; He sat beside
her, wearily. &#8220;There will be time for that. He
is talking now with the Long Arrow and the
old warriors. He is not fond of the Long
Arrow.&#8221; In the excitement he had not seen
that she was limp and exhausted, but now he
spoke quickly, &#8220;They have hurt you, Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not hurt. But you&ndash;&ndash;your
head&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a bruise.&#8221; He drew his sleeve across
his forehead. &#8220;I had rather a bad one in the
arm.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>He rolled up his sleeve in a matter-of-fact
way. Her eyes filled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, M&#8217;sieu, you did not tell me. I can
help you. Wait, I will be back.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose, and started toward the spring, but
he sprang to her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not trouble. It is not bad.
There will be time for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Come with me if you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ran with nervous steps; and he strode
after. At the side of the bubbling pool she
knelt, and looked up impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will not do to let this go, M&#8217;sieu. Can
you roll your sleeve higher?&#8221;</p>
<p>He tried, but the heavy cloth was stiff.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will take off the coat&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He unlaced it at the breast, and drew it off.
She took his wrist, and plunged his arm into
the pool, washing it with quick, gentle fingers,
drying it on his coat. Then she leaned back,
half perplexed, and looked around.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A cloth. No,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;as he reached for his
coat;&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;that is too rough. Here, M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
she tore a strip from her skirt, and wrapped it
around the forearm. &#8220;Hold it with your other
hand, just a moment.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>She hurried to the hut, and returning with
needle and thread, stitched the bandage. Then
she helped him on with his coat, and they
walked slowly to the hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Father Claude?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He pointed to a thicket beyond the hut.
There, kneeling by the body of a dying Indian,
was the priest, praying silently. He had
baptized the warrior with dew from the leaves
at his side, and now was claiming his soul for
the greater King in whose service his own life
had been spent.</p>
<p>The Captain sat beside the maid, their backs
to the logs, and watched the shifting groups
of warriors. He told her of the arrival of the
Big Throat, and of the confusion that resulted.
Then for a time they were silent, waiting for
the impromptu council to reach a conclusion.
The warriors finally began to drift away,
though the younger and more curious ones
still hung about. A group of braves came
slowly toward the hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the Big Throat in front,&#8221; said Menard.
&#8220;The broad-shouldered warrior beside
him is the Talking Eagle, the best-known chief
of the clan of the Bear. They are almost here.
We had better stand. Are you too tired?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude had seen the group approaching,
and he joined Menard. The Big Throat
stood motionless and looked at the Captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother, the Big Buffalo, has asked
to speak with the Big Throat,&#8221; he said at
length.</p>
<p>Menard bowed, but did not reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;He asks for his release,&ndash;&ndash;and for the
holy man and the squaw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo asks nothing save what
the chiefs of the Onondagas would give to a
chief taken in battle. The Long Arrow has lied
to the Big Buffalo. He has soiled his hands
with the blood of women and holy Fathers.
The Big Buffalo was told by Onontio, whom
all must obey, to come to the Onondagas and
give them his word. The Long Arrow was
impatient. He would not let him journey in
peace. He wished to injure him; to let his
blood. Now the Big Buffalo is here. He asks
that he may be heard at the council, to give
the chief the word of Onontio. That is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Big Throat&#8217;s face was inscrutable. He
looked at Menard without a word until the
silence grew tense, and the maid caught her
breath. Then he said, with the cool, diplomatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
tone that concealed whatever kindness
or justice may have prompted the words:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo shall be heard at the
council to-night. The chiefs of the Onondagas
never are deaf to the words of Onontio.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XII_THE_LONG_HOUSE' id='CHAPTER_XII_THE_LONG_HOUSE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>THE LONG HOUSE.</h3>
</div>
<p>The council-house was a hundred paces or
more in length. The frame was of tall
hickory saplings planted in the ground in two
rows, with the tops bent over and lashed together
in the form of an arch. The building
was not more than fifteen yards wide. The
lower part of the outer wall was of logs, the
upper part and the roof of bark. Instead of a
chimney there was a narrow opening in the
roof, extending the length of the building.</p>
<p>A row of smouldering fires reached nearly
from end to end of the house. The smoke
struggled upward, but failing, for the greater
part, to find the outlet overhead, remained inside
to clog the air and dim the eyes. The
chiefs sat in a long ellipse in the central part of
the house, some sitting erect with legs crossed,
others half reclining, while a few lay sprawling,
their chins resting on their hands. The Big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
Throat sat with the powerful chiefs of the nation
at one end. The lesser sachems, including the
Long Arrow, sat each before his own band of
followers. The second circle was made up of
the older and better-known warriors. Behind
these, pressing close to catch every word of the
argument, were braves, youths, women, and
children, mixed together indiscriminately. A
low platform extended the length of the building
against the wall on each side, and this held
another crowding, elbowing, whispering mass
of redskins. Every chief and warrior, as well
as most of the women, held each a pipe between
his teeth, and puffed out clouds of smoke into
the thick air.</p>
<p>The maid&#8217;s eyes smarted and blurred in
the smoke. It reached her throat, and she
coughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie down, Mademoiselle,&#8221; said Menard.
&#8220;Breathe close to the ground and it will not be
so bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated, looking at the Big Throat,
who sat with arms folded, proud and dignified.
Then she smiled, and lay almost flat on the
ground, breathing in the current of less impure
air that passed beneath the smoke. They had
been placed in the inner circle, next to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
chiefs of the nations, where Menard&#8217;s words
would have the weight that, to the mind of the
Big Throat, was due to a representative of the
French Governor, even in time of war. Father
Claude, sitting on the left of the maid, was
looking quietly into the fire. He had committed
the case into the hands of Providence,
and he was certain that the right words would
be given to the Captain.</p>
<p>It was nearing the close of the afternoon. A
beam of sunlight slipped in at one end of the
roof-opening, and slanted downward, clearing a
shining way through the smoke. A Cayuga
chief was speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The corn is ripening in the fields about the
Onondaga village. As I came down the hills
of the west to-day I saw the green tops waving
in the wind, and I was glad, for I knew that
my brothers would feast in plenty, that their
Manitous have been kind. The Cayugas, too,
have great fields of corn, and the Senecas.
Their women have worked faithfully that the
land might be plentiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a storm is breaking over the cornfields
of the Senecas. It is a great cloud that has
come down from the north, with the flash of
fire and the roar of thunder, and with hailstones
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
of lead that will leave no stalk standing. My
brothers know the strength of the north wind.
They have not forgotten other storms that
would have laid waste the villages of the Senecas
and the Mohawks. And they have not
forgotten their Manitous, who have whispered
to them when the clouds appeared in the northern
sky, &#8216;Rise up, Mohawks and Oneidas and
Onondagas and Cayugas and Senecas, and
stand firmly against this storm, and your
homes and your fields shall not be destroyed.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The house was silent with interest. The
maid raised her head and watched the stolid
faces of the chiefs in the inner circle. Not an
expression changed from beginning to end of
the speech. Beyond, she could see other,
younger faces, some eager, some bitter, some
defiant, some smiling, and all showing the
flush of excitement,&ndash;&ndash;but these grim old chiefs
had long schooled their faces to hide their
thoughts. They held their blankets close, and
puffed deliberately at their pipes with hardly a
movement of the lips.</p>
<p>The Cayuga went on:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Messengers have come to the Cayugas from
their brothers, the Senecas, telling of the storm
that is rushing on them. The Cayugas know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
the hearts of the Five Nations. When the Mohawks
have risen to defend their homes, the
hearts of the Cayugas have been warm, and
they have taken up the hatchet with their
brothers. When the Onondagas have gone on
the war-path, Senecas and Cayugas have gone
with them, and the trouble of one has been the
trouble of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The good White Father is no longer the
war chief of the white men. The Great Mountain,
who knew the voice of the forest, who
spoke with the tongue of the redman, has
been called back to his Great-Chief-Across-the-Water.
His word was the word of kindness,
and when he spoke our hearts were warm. But
another mountain is now the war chief, a mountain
that spits fire and lead, that speaks with
a double tongue. The Five Nations have
never turned from a foe. The enemy of the
Senecas has been the enemy of the Mohawks.
If the storm strikes the fields of the Senecas,
their brothers will not turn away and stop their
ears and say they do not hear the thunder, for
they remember the storms of other seasons,
and they know that the hail that destroys one
field will destroy other fields. And so this is
the word of the Cayugas:&ndash;&ndash;Let all the warriors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
of the Five Nations take up the hatchet; let
them go on the war-path to tell this white chief
with the double tongue that the Five Nations
are one nation; that they are bolder than
thunder, swifter than fire, stronger than lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid found it hard, with her imperfect
knowledge of the language, to follow his metaphors.
She had partly risen, heedless of the
smoke, and was leaning forward with her
eyes fixed on the stern face of the speaker.
Menard bent down, and half smiled at her
excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;He is for
war?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he naturally would be.&#8221; There was a
stir about the house, as the speech ended, and
they could speak softly without drawing notice.
&#8220;The Cayugas are nearer to the Senecas than
the other nations, and they fear that they too
may suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you do not think they all feel with
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the Oneidas and Mohawks, and even
the Onondagas, are too far to the east to feel
in danger. They know how hard it would be
for the Governor to move far from his base in
this country. It may be that the younger warriors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
will be for fighting, but the older heads
will think of the corn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the Big Throat speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but not like these others. He talks
simply and forcibly. That is the way when a
chief&#8217;s reputation is made. The Big Throat
won his name, as a younger brave, by his wonderful
oratory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;you will be heard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I think so. We must not talk any
more now. They will not like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Cayuga was followed by a wrinkled old
chief of the Oneidas, called the Hundred Skins.
He stepped forward and stood near the fire, his
blanket drawn close about his shoulders, where
the red light could play on his face. A whisper
ran around the outer circle, for it was known
that he stood for peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Cayuga brother has spoken wisely,&#8221; he
began, in a low but distinct voice. He looked
slowly about the house to command attention.
&#8220;The Oneidas have not forgotten the storms
of other seasons; they have not forgotten the
times of starving, when neither the Manitous
of the redman nor the God of the white man
came to help. The grain stood brown in the
fields; the leaves hung dead from the trees;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
there was no wind to cool the fever that carried
away old men and young men, squaws and
children. And when the wind came, and the
cold and snow of the winter, there was no food
in the lodges of the Five Nations. My brothers
have heard that the corn is rising to a man&#8217;s
height&ndash;&ndash;they have seen it to-day in the fields
of the Onondagas. They know that this corn
must be cared for like the children of their
lodges, if they wish food to eat when the winter
comes and the fields are dead. They know
what it will cost them to take the war-path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve moons have not gone since the
chiefs of the Senecas rose in this house and
called on the warriors of the Five Nations to
take up the hatchet against the white men of the
north. The skins of the beaver were talking in
their ears. They saw great canoes on the white
man&#8217;s rivers loaded with skins, and their hands
itched and their hearts turned inward. Then
the wise chiefs of the Oneidas and Cayugas and
Onondagas and Mohawks spoke well. They
were not on the war-path; the hatchet was deep
in the ground, and young trees were growing
over it. Then the Oneidas said that the White
Chief would not forget if the Senecas heeded
their itching hands and listened to the bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
medicine of the beaver skins in their ears. But
the Senecas were not wise, and they took up
the hatchet.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the word of the Oneidas to the
chiefs of the Long House:&ndash;&ndash;The Seneca has
put his foot in the trap. Then shall the Oneida
and Onondaga and Cayuga and Mohawk rush
after, that they too may put in their feet where
they can get away only by gnawing off the
bone? Shall the wise chiefs of the Long
House run into fight like the dogs of their
village? The Oneidas say no! The Senecas
took up the hatchet; let them bury it where
they can. And when the winter comes, the
Oneidas will send them corn that they may not
have another time of starving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard was watching the Oneida with eyes
that fairly snapped. The low voice stopped,
and another murmur ran around the outer circles.
The Hundred Skins had spoken boldly,
and the Cayuga young men looked stern. The
chief stepped slowly back and resumed his seat,
and then, not before, did Menard&#8217;s face relax.
He looked about cautiously to see if he was
observed, then settled back and gazed stolidly
into the fire. The old Oneida had played
directly into his hand; by letting slip the motive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
for the Seneca raid of the winter before, he
had strengthened the one weak point in the
speech Menard meant to make.</p>
<p>The next speaker was one of the younger war
chiefs of the Onondagas. He made an effort
to speak with the calmness of the older men,
but there was now and then a flash in his eye
and an ill-controlled vigour in his voice that told
Menard and the priest how strong was the war
party of this village. The Onondaga plunged
into his speech without the customary deliberation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our brothers, the Senecas, have sent to us
for aid. We have been called to the Long
House to hear the voice of the Senecas,&ndash;&ndash;not
from the lips of their chiefs, for they have fields
and villages to guard against the white man,
and they are not here to stand before the council
and ask what an Iroquois never refuses.
The Cayuga has spoken with the voice of the
Seneca. Shall the chiefs and warriors of the
Long House say to the Cayuga, &#8216;Go back to
your village and send messengers to the Senecas
to tell them that their brothers of the Long
House have corn and squaws and children that
are more to them than the battles of their
brothers&ndash;&ndash;tell the Senecas that the Oneidas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
must eat and cannot fight&#8217;? There is corn in
the fields of the Oneidas. But there is food for
all the Five Nations in the great house on the
Lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker paused to let his words sink in.
Menard whispered to the maid, in reply to an
inquiring look. &#8220;He means the Governor&#8217;s
base of supplies at La Famine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Onondaga&#8217;s voice began to rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the Oneida thinks of his corn, is he
afraid to leave it to his squaws? Does he hesitate
because he thinks the white warriors are
strong enough to turn on him and drive him
from his villages? This is not the speech that
young warriors are taught to expect from the
Long House. When has the Long House been
guided by fear? No. If the Oneida is hungry,
let him eat from the stores of the white
man, at the house on the Lake. The Cayugas
and Onondagas will draw their belts tighter,
that the Oneida may be filled.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young chief looked defiantly around.
There was a murmur from the outer circle, but
the chiefs were grave and silent. The Hundred
Skins gazed meditatively into the fire as
if he had not heard, slowly puffing at his pipe.
The taunt of cowardice had sprung out in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
heat of youth; his dignity demanded that he
ignore it. The speech had its effect on the
Cayugas and the young men, but the older
heads were steady.</p>
<p>Other chiefs rose, talked, and resumed their
places, giving all views of the situation and of
the relations between the Iroquois and the
French,&ndash;&ndash;but still little expression showed on
the inner circle of faces. The maid after a
time grew more accustomed to the smoke, and
sat up. She was puzzled by the conflicting
arguments and the lack of enthusiasm. Fully
two hours had passed, and there was no sign
of an agreement. The eager spectators, in the
outer rows, gradually settled down.</p>
<p>During a lull between two speeches, Menard
spoke to the maid, who was beginning to show
traces of weariness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be a long sitting, Mademoiselle.
We must make the best of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She smiled. &#8220;I am a little tired.
It has been a hard day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too hard, poor child. But I hope to see
you safe very soon now. I am relying on the
Big Throat. He, with a few of the older
chiefs, sees farther than these hot-heads. He
knows that France must conquer in the end,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
and is wise enough to make terms whenever
he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can he, M&#8217;sieu? Will they obey him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not obey, exactly; he will not command
them. Indians have no discipline such as ours.
The chiefs rely on their judgment and influence.
But they have followed the guidance of the Big
Throat for too many years to leave it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another chief rose to speak. The sun had
gone, and the long building was growing dark
rapidly. A number of squaws came through
the circle, throwing wood on the fires. The
new flames shot up, and threw a flickering
light on the copper faces, many of which still
wore the paint of the morning. The smoke
lay over them in wavering films, now and again
half hiding some sullen face until it seemed to
fade away into the darkness.</p>
<p>At last the whole situation lay clear before
the council. Some speakers were for war, some
for peace, others for aiding the Senecas as a
matter of principle. The house was divided.</p>
<p>There was a silence, and the pipes glowed in
the dusk; then the Long Arrow rose. The
listless spectators stirred and leaned forward.
The maid, too, was moved, feeling that at last
the moment of decision was near. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
surprised to see that he had none of the savage
excitement of the morning. He was as quiet
and tactful in speech as the Big Throat himself.</p>
<p>Slowly the Long Arrow drew his blanket
close about him and began to speak. The
house grew very still, for the whole tribe knew
that he had, in his anger of the morning, disputed
the authority of the Big Throat. There
had been hot words, and the great chief had
rebuked him contemptuously within the hearing
of half a hundred warriors. Now he was
to stand before the council, and not a man in
that wide circle but wondered how much he
would dare to say.</p>
<p>He seemed not to observe the curious
glances. Simply and quietly he began the
narrative of the capture of the hunting party
at Fort Frontenac. At the first words Menard
turned to Father Claude with a meaning look.
The maid saw it, and her lips framed a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is better than I hoped,&#8221; Menard whispered.
&#8220;He is bringing it up himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not two moons have waned,&#8221; the Long
Arrow was saying, &#8220;since five score brave
young warriors left our village for the hunt.
They left the hatchet buried under the trees.
They took no war-paint. The Great Mountain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
had said that there was peace between
the redman and the white man; he had asked
the Onondagas to hunt on the banks of the
Great River; he had told them that his white
sons at the Stone House would take them as
brothers into their lodges. When the Great
Mountain said this, through the mouths of the
holy Fathers, he lied.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words came out in the same low, even
tone in which he had begun speaking, but
they sank deep. The house was hushed; even
the stirring of the children on the benches
died away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Great Mountain has lied to his children,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Menard&#8217;s
keen ears caught the bitter,
if covered, sarcasm in the last two words; they
had been Governor Frontenac&#8217;s favourite term
in addressing the Iroquois&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and his children
know his voice no longer. There is corn in the
fields? Let it grow or rot. There are squaws
and children in our lodges? Let them live or
die. It is not the Senecas who ask our aid; it
is the voice of a hundred sons and brothers and
youths and squaws calling from far beyond the
great water,&ndash;&ndash;calling from chains, calling from
fever, calling from the Happy Hunting Ground,
where they have gone without guns or corn or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
blankets, where they lie with nothing to comfort
them.&#8221; The Long Arrow stood erect, with
head thrown back and eyes fixed on the opposite
wall. &#8220;Our sons and brothers went like
children to the Stone House of the white man.
Their hands were stretched before them, their
muskets hung empty from their shoulders, their
bowstrings were loosened; the calumet was in
their hands. But the sons of Onontio lied as
their fathers had taught them. They took the
calumet; they called the Onondagas into their
great lodge; and in the sleep of the white man&#8217;s
fire-water they chained them. Five score Onondagas
have gone to be slaves to the Great-Chief-Across-the-Water,
who loves his children
and is kind to them, and would take them all
under his arm where no storm can harm them.
My brothers of the Long House have heard
the promises of Onontio, and they have seen the
fork in his tongue. And so they choose this
time to speak of corn and squaws and children.&#8221;
The keen, closely set eyes slowly lowered and
swept around the circle. &#8220;Is this the time to
speak of corn? Our Manitou has sent this
Great Mountain into our country. He has
placed him in our hands so that we may strike,
so that we may tell the white man with our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
muskets that our Manitou is stern and just, and
that no Iroquois will listen to the idle words of
a double tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, readjusted his blanket, and then
stood motionless, that all might digest his
words. Then, after a long wait, he went on:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are children to-day in our lodges who
can remember the Big Buffalo, who can remember
our adopted son who shared our fires and
food, who shared our hunts, who lived with us
as freely as an Onondaga. We saw him every
day, and we forgot that his heart was as white
as his skin, for his tongue was the tongue of an
Onondaga. We forgot that the white man has
two tongues. It has not been long, my brothers,&ndash;&ndash;not
long enough for an Onondaga to forget.
But the Big Buffalo is a mangy dog. He forgot
the brothers of his lodge. He it was who
took the Onondaga hunters and carried them
away to be slaves. But the Manitou did not
forget. He has put this Big Buffalo into our
hands, that we may give him what should be
given to the dog who forgets his master.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the Long Arrow paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; this is not the time to speak of corn.
It is not the Senecas who call us, it is our
brothers and their squaws and children. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
Iroquois have been the greatest warriors of
the world. They have driven the Hurons to
the far northern forests; the Illinois to the
Father of Waters, two moons&#8217; travel to the
west; the Delawares to the waters of the south.
They have told the white man to stay within
his boundaries, and he has stayed. They have
been kind to the white man; they have welcomed
the holy Fathers into their villages. But
now the Great Mountain makes slaves of the
Onondagas. He brings his warriors across the
Great Lake to punish the Senecas and destroy
their lodges. Shall the Long House of the
Five Nations turn a white face to this Great
Mountain? Shall the Long House call out in
a shaking voice, &#8216;See, Onontio, there are no
heads on our arrows, no flints in our muskets!
our hatchets are dull, our knives nicked and
rusted! come, Onontio, and strike us, that
we may know you are our master and our
father&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Long Arrow&#8217;s voice had risen only
slightly, but now it dropped; he went on, in
a tone that was keen as a knife, but so low
that those at the farther end of the house
leaned forward and sat motionless.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been said to-day to the Long House
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
that we shall close our ears to the thunder of
the Great Mountain, that we should think of
our corn and our squaws, and leave the Senecas
to fight their own battles. But the Long House
will not do this. The Long House will not
give up the liberty that has been the pride of
the Iroquois since first the rivers ran to the
lake, and the moss grew on the trees, and the
wind waved the tops of the long grass. The
Great Mountain has come to take this liberty.
He shall not have it. No; he shall lose his
own&ndash;&ndash;we will leave his bones to dry where
the Seneca dogs run loose. The Big Buffalo
shall die to tell the white man that the Iroquois
never forgets; the Great Mountain shall
die to tell the white man that the Iroquois is
free.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>THE VOICE OF THE GREAT MOUNTAIN.</h3>
</div>
<p>There was no lack of interest now in the
council. The weariness left the maid&#8217;s
eyes as she followed the speeches that came in
rapid succession. There was still the disagreement,
the confusion of a dozen different views
and demands; but the speech of the Long
Arrow had pointed the discussion, it had set
up an opinion to be either defended or attacked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the Big Throat speak now?&#8221; asked
Mademoiselle, leaning close to Menard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think so. I don&#8217;t know what will
come next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When will you speak, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until word from the Big Throat. It
would be a breach of courtesy.&#8221;</p>
<p>One warrior, a member of the Beaver family,
and probably a blood relative of the Beaver who
had been killed in the fight of the morning, took
advantage of the pause to speak savagely for
war and vengeance. He counted those who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
had fallen since the sun rose, and appealed to
their families to destroy the man who had killed
them. He was not a chief, but his fiery speech
aroused a murmur of approval from scattered
groups of the spectators. This sympathy from
those about him, with the anger which was
steadily fed by his own hot words, gradually
drove from his mind the observance of etiquette
which was so large a part of an important council.
Still speaking, he left his place, and walking
slowly between two of the fires and across
the circle, paused before Menard.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dog whom we fed and grew has turned
against its masters, as the dogs of your own
lodges, my brothers, will bite the hand that pats
their heads. It has hung about outside of the
Great Lodge to kill the hunter who sees no
danger ahead. And now, when this dog is
caught, and tied at your door, would not my
brothers bring him to the end of all evil
beasts?&#8221; As he finished, he made a gesture
of bitter contempt and kicked Menard.</p>
<p>A shout went up, and voices clamoured, protesting,
denouncing, exulting. The Captain&#8217;s
eyes flashed fire. It was not for a second that
he hesitated. Weakness, to an Indian, is the
last, the greatest fault. If he should take this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
insult, it would end forever not only his own
chance of escape, with the maid and the priest,
but all hope of safety for the Governor&#8217;s column.
He sprang to his feet before the Indian, whose
arm was still stretched out in the gesture, and
with two quick blows knocked him clear of his
feet, and then kicked him into the fire.</p>
<p>A dozen hands dragged the warrior from the
fire and stamped out a blaze that had started in
the fringe of one legging. Every man in the
house was on his feet, shouting and screaming.
Menard stood with his hands at his side, smiling,
with the same look of scorn he had worn in
the morning when they led him to the torture.
Father Claude drew closer to the maid, and
the two sat without moving. Then above the
uproar rose the voice of the Big Throat; and
slowly the noise died away. The chief stepped
to the centre of the circle, but before he could
speak Menard had reached his side, and motioned
to him to be silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brothers,&#8221; he said, looking straight at
the fallen warrior, who was scrambling to his
feet,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;my brothers, the Big Buffalo is sorry
that the Onondagas have among them a fool
who thinks himself a warrior. The Big Buffalo
is not here to fight fools. He is here to talk to
chiefs. He is glad that the fool speaks only for
himself and not for the brave men of the Long
House.&#8221; He walked deliberately back and
resumed his seat by the maid.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
<img src='images/illus-256.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 614px; height: 366px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center; width: 614px;'>
&#8220;Menard stood ... smiling with the same look of scorn he had worn ... when they led him to the torture.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Courage, Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said close to
her ear. &#8220;It is all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will they do, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I have won. Wait&ndash;&ndash;the Big
Throat is speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one the warriors fell back to their
seats. Some were muttering, some were smiling;
but all were subdued. The Big Throat&#8217;s
voice was calm and firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo has spoken well. The
word of a fool is not the word of the Long
House. The White Chief comes to give us
the voice of Onontio, and we will listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned toward Menard, and then resumed
his seat.</p>
<p>The Captain rose, and looked about the circle.
The chiefs were motionless. Even the
Long Arrow, now that his outburst was past,
closed his lips over the stem of his pipe and
gazed at the smoke. Father Claude drew forward
the bundle and opened it, the maid helping.
Some of the boys behind them crowded
closer to see the presents.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>Menard spoke slowly and quietly. The rustling
and whispering in the outer circle died
away, so that every word was distinct.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the Five Nations have given their
word to another nation, it has not been necessary
to sign a paper; it has not been necessary
to keep a record. The Long Arrow has said
that the Iroquois do not forget. He is right.
The words that have gone out from the councils
have never been forgotten. I see here, in this
council, the faces of warriors who have grown
old in serving their people, of chiefs who are
bent and wrinkled with the cares of many generations.
I see in the eyes of my brothers that
they have not forgotten the Onontio, who went
away to his greater chief only five seasons ago.
They have seen this Onontio in war and peace.
They have listened to his silver tongue in the
council. They have called themselves his children,
and have known that he was a wise and
kind father. They remember the promises they
made him. But the Senecas did not remember.
The Seneca has no ears; he has a hole in his
head, and the words of his father have passed
through. The Senecas promised Onontio that
they would not take the white man&#8217;s beaver.
But when the English came to their lodges and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
whispered in their ears, the hole was stopped.
The English whispered of brandy and guns and
powder and hatchets and knives. They told
the Senecas that these things should be given
to them if they would steal the beaver. The
English are cowards&ndash;&ndash;they sent the Senecas
to do what they were afraid to do. And then
the hole in the Seneca&#8217;s head was stopped&ndash;&ndash;the
Seneca who had forgotten the words of
Onontio remembered the words of the English.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brothers of the Long House had not
forgotten the promises they had given Onontio.
When the Seneca chiefs called for aid in stealing
the beaver, my brothers were wise and said
no. The Onondagas and Cayugas and Oneidas
and Mohawks were loyal&ndash;&ndash;they kept their
promise, and Onontio has not forgotten; he
will not forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what the Great Mountain would say
to you, my brothers: You have been faithful to
your word, and he is pleased. He knows that
the Onondagas are his children. And he
knows why the Senecas left their villages and
fields to plunder his white children. It was
for the skins of the beaver, which the white
braves had taken from their own forests and
would bring in their canoes down the Ottawa
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
to trade at the white man&#8217;s villages. He
knows, my brothers, that the Senecas had
tired of their promises, and now would steal
the beaver and sell it to the English. What
comes to the boy when he climbs the tree to
steal the honey which the bees have gathered
and taken to their home? Is he not stung
and bitten until he cries that he will not disturb
the bees again? The Senecas have tried
to take that which is to the white man as the
honey is to the bee; and they too must be
stung and bitten until they have learned that
the Great Mountain will always protect those
who deserve his aid. He has sent you a comb
from the shell of the great sea-tortoise, more
precious than a thousand wampum shells, to tell
you that as the sea-monster pursues its enemies,
so will he pursue those who cannot keep their
promises&ndash;&ndash;who lie to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Claude handed him the comb, and he
laid it before the Big Throat. It was evident
that he had been closely followed, and he
started on his second word with more vigour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your chiefs have spoken to-day of the
storm cloud that has swept down from the
north; your runners have told you that it is
not a cloud, but an army, that has come up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
the great river and across the lake of Frontenac
to the country of the Senecas. Do my
brothers know what a great army follows their
White Father when he sets out to punish his
children? More than twenty score of trained
warriors are in this war party, and every warrior
carries a musket; to-night they are marching
on the Seneca villages. They will destroy
those villages as a brave would destroy a nest
of hornets in his lodge. Not one lodge will be
left standing, not one stalk of corn.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Oneidas and Onondagas and Cayugas
talk of their cornfields. But even the Cayugas
need have no fear. For Onontio is a wise and
just father; he punishes only those that offend
him. The Senecas have broken their promises,
and the Senecas must be punished, but the
other nations are still the children of the Great
Mountain, and his hand is over them. The
Big Buffalo has come from the Great Mountain
to tell you that he will not harm the Cayugas;
their fields and lodges are safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a stir at this, and then quiet, as
the spectators settled back to hear the rest of
Menard&#8217;s speech. Here was a captive who
spoke as boldly as their own chiefs, who commanded
their attention as a present bearer from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
the White Chief. And they knew, all of them,
from the way in which he was choosing his
words, coolly ignoring the more important
subjects until he should be ready to deal with
them, that he spoke with authority. He knew
his auditors, and he let them see that he knew
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Senecas have listened to the English.
What do they expect from them? Do they
think that the English wish to help them?
Do they look for wealth and support from the
English? My brothers of the Long House
know better. They have seen the English
hide from the anger of the Great Mountain.
They have seen the iron hand of New France
reach out across the northern country, and
along the shores of the great lakes, and down
the Father of Waters in the far west, while the
English were clinging to their little strip of
land on the edge of the sea. My brothers
know who is strong and who is weak. Never
have the fields of the Five Nations been so rich
and so large. No wars have disturbed them.
They have grown and prospered. Do the
Senecas think it is the English who have
made them great? No&ndash;&ndash;the Senecas are not
fools. They know that the Great Mountain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
has driven away their enemies and given them
peace and plenty. My brothers of the Long
House remembered this when the Senecas
came to them and asked for aid in stealing
the beaver. They stopped their ears; they
knew that Onontio was their father, and that
they must be faithful to him if they wished to
have plenty in their lodges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Onontio is a patient father. Let the Senecas
repent, and he will forgive them. Let
them bury the hatchet, and he will forgive
them. Let them be satisfied with peace and
honest trade, and he will buy their furs, and
give them fair payment. And then their cornfields
shall grow so large that a fleet runner
cannot pass around them in half a moon. They
shall have no more famine. Their pouches
shall be full of powder, their muskets new and
bright. Their women shall have warm clothing
and many beads. Nowhere shall there be
such prosperous nations as here among the
Iroquois. If the Senecas have broken their
pledges and have not repented, they must be
punished. But the Cayugas and Onondagas
and Oneidas and Mohawks have not broken
their pledges. The Great Mountain has sent
the Big Buffalo to tell them that he has seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
that they are loyal, and he is pleased. He
knows that they are wise. If the Onondagas
have a grievance, he will not forget it, and if
they ask for vengeance he will hear them.
The Great Mountain knows that the Onondagas
are his children, that they will not make
war upon their father. He sends this coat of
seal fur that the hearts of the Cayugas and
Onondagas and Oneidas and Mohawks may
be kept warm, and to tell them that he loves
them and will protect them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid&#8217;s eyes sparkled with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish they would speak, or laugh, or do
something,&#8221; she whispered to Father Claude,
&#8220;Are they not interested? They hardly seem
to hear him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest looked at her gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;they are listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The time had come to speak of La Grange.
The Captain had been steadily leading up to
this moment. He had tried to show the Indians
that they had no complaint, no cause for
war, unless it was the one incident at Fort
Frontenac. He knew that the chiefs not only
understood his argument, but that they were
quietly waiting for him to approach this real
cause of trouble, and were probably curious to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
see how he would meet it. The mind of the
Iroquois, when in the council, separated
from the heat and emotion of the dance, the
hunt, the war-path, was remarkably keen.
Menard felt sure that if he could present his
case logically and firmly, it would appeal to
most of the chief and older warriors. Then
the maid came into his thoughts, and he knew,
though he did not look down, that she was
gazing up at him and waiting. He hesitated
for a moment longer. The chiefs, too, were
waiting. The Long House was hushed:&ndash;&ndash;three
hundred faces were looking at him
through the twisting, curling smoke that
blurred the scene into an unreal picture. Yes,
the time had come to speak of La Grange; and
he spoke the first words hurriedly, stepping
half-unconsciously farther from the maid.</p>
<p>There was a part of the true story of the
capture which he did not tell,&ndash;&ndash;the Governor&#8217;s
part. For the rest, it was all there, every word
about La Grange and his treacherous act coming
out almost brutally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your speakers have told you of the hunting
party that was taken into the stone house,
and put into chains, and sent away to be slaves
to the Chief-Across-the-Water. There is a chief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
at the stone house whom you have seen fighting
bravely in many a battle. He is a bold
warrior; none is so quick or so tireless as Captain
la Grange. But he has a devil in his
heart. The bad medicine of white man and
redman, the fire-water, is always close to him,
ready to whisper to him and guide him. It
was not the father at Quebec that broke the
faith with the Onondagas. It was not the Big
Buffalo. If the Big Buffalo could so forget
his brothers of the Onondaga lodges, he would
not have come back to the Long House to tell
them of the sorrow of the Great Mountain.
My brothers have seen the Big Buffalo in war
and peace&ndash;&ndash;they know that he would not do
this.</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil was in Captain la Grange&#8217;s
heart. He captured my brothers. He told
the Great Mountain that it was a war party,
that he had taken them prisoners fairly. He
lied to the Great Mountain. When the Great
Mountain asked the Big Buffalo to bring the
prisoners to his great village on the river, the
Big Buffalo could not say, &#8216;No, I am no longer
your son!&#8217; When the Great Mountain commands,
the Big Buffalo obeys. With sorrow
in his heart he did as his father told him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>Menard was struggling to put the maid out
of his thoughts, to keep in view only the safety
of the column and the welfare of New France.
And as the words came rapidly to his lips and
fell upon the ears of that silent audience, he
began to feel that they believed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brothers,&#8221; he said, with more feeling
than they knew, &#8220;it is five seasons since I left
your village for the land of the white man. In
that time you have had no thought that I was
not indeed your brother, the son of your chief.
You have known other Frenchmen. Father
Claude, who sits by my side; Father Jean de
Lamberville, who has given his many years to
save you for the great white man&#8217;s Manitou;
Major d&#8217;Orvilliers, who has never failed to give
food and shelter to the starving hunter at his
great stone house,&ndash;&ndash;I could name a hundred
others. You know that these are honest, that
what they promise will be done. But in every
village is a fool, in every family is one who is
weak and cannot earn a name on the hunt.
You have a warrior in this house who to-day
raised his hand against a visitor in the great
council. My brothers,&ndash;&ndash;it is with sadness
that I say it,&ndash;&ndash;not all the white men are true
warriors. You are wise chiefs and brave warriors;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
you know that because one man is a dog,
it is not so with all his nation. The Great
Mountain sends me to you, and I speak in his
voice. I tell you that Captain la Grange is
a dog, that he has broken the faith of the
white man and the redman, that the father at
Quebec and the Great-Chief-Across-the-Water,
who are so quick to punish their red children,
will also punish the white. The white men
are good. They love the Onondagas. And
if any white man breaks the faith, he shall be
punished.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice had risen, and he was speaking in
a glow that seemed to drop a spark into each
listening heart. He knew now that they believed.
He turned abruptly for the present.
Father Claude was so absorbed in following
the speech, and in watching the maid, who
sat with flushed cheeks and lowered eyes, that
he was not ready, and Menard stooped and
took the book. He could not avoid seeing
the maid, when he looked down; and the
priest felt a sudden pain in his own heart to
see the look of utter weariness that came into
the Captain&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Menard turned the leaves of the book for a
moment, as if to collect himself, and then held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
it open so that the Indians could see the bright
pictures. There was a craning of necks in the
outer circles.</p>
<p>&#8220;In these picture writings is told the story
of the &#8216;Ceremonies of the Mass applied to the
Passion of Our Lord,&#8217;&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;And
our Lord is your Great Spirit. It brings you
a message; it tells you that the white man is
a good man, who punishes his own son as
sternly as his red child.&#8221;</p>
<p>The present pleased the Big Throat. He
would not let his curiosity appear in the council,
but he dropped the book so that it fell
open, seemingly by accident, and his eyes
strayed to it now and then during the last
word of the speech. Menard did not hesitate
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told my Onondaga brothers that
this white dog shall be punished,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;When this word is given in your council in
the voice of Onontio, it is a word that cannot
be broken. Wind is not strong enough, thunder
is not loud enough, waves are not fierce
enough, snows are not cold enough, powder is
not swift enough to break it.&#8221; The words
came swiftly from his lips. Calm old chiefs
leaned forward that they might catch every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
syllable. Eyes were brighter with interest.
The Long Arrow, thinking of his son and
fearing lest the man who killed him should
slip from his grasp, grew troubled and more
stern. At last Menard turned, and taking the
portrait from the priest&#8217;s hands held it up,
slowly turning it so that all could see it in
the uncertain firelight. At first they were puzzled
and surprised; then a murmur of recognition
ran from lip to lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know this maid,&#8221; Menard was saying,
&#8220;this maid who to all who love the Iroquois, to
all who love the church, the Great Spirit, is a
saint. Her spirit has been for many moons
in the happy hunting ground. The snow has
lain cold and heavy on her grave. The night
bird has sung her beauty in the empty forest.
Catherine Outasoren has come back from the
land where the corn is always growing, where
the snows can never fall; she has come back to
bear you the word of the Great Mountain. She
has come to tell you that the dog who broke
the oath of the white man to the Onondagas
must suffer. This is the pledge of the Great
Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly, and stood looking with
flashing eyes at the circle of chiefs. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
silence for a moment, then a murmur that rapidly
rose and swelled into the loud chatter of
many voices. Menard laid the portrait at the
feet of the Big Throat, and took his seat at the
side of the maid,&ndash;&ndash;but he did not look at her
nor she at him. Father Claude sat patiently
waiting.</p>
<p>There was low talk among the chiefs. Then
a warrior came and led the captives out of
doors, through a long passage that opened
between two rows of crowding Indians. The
night was clear, and the air was sweet to their
nostrils. They walked slowly down the path.
A group of young braves kept within a few rods.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be late,&#8221; said Menard, in a weak
effort to break the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Father Claude.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we had better go back to our
hut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the priest again. But the maid
was silent.</p>
<p>They sat on the grass plot before the door,
none of them having any words that fitted the
moment. Menard brought out a blanket and
spread it on the ground, that the maid need not
touch the dew-laden grass.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>WHERE THE DEAD SIT.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;They need not starve us,&#8221; said Menard,
trying to speak lightly. &#8220;I am hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see what chance we have for a supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up and walked along the path looking
for the guards. In a short time he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will bring us something. The sentiment
is not so strong against us now, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They change quickly,&#8221; said Father Claude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It is the Big Throat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yourself, M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; the maid said impulsively.
&#8220;You have done it, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell. We do not know what the
council may decide. It may be morning before
they will come to an agreement. The Long
Arrow will fight to the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the other, M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;the one who
attacked you,&ndash;&ndash;he too will fight?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He is nothing. When an Iroquois shows
himself a coward his influence is gone forever.
It may be even that they will give him a new
name because of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are times when a small accident or
a careless word will change the mind of a
nation,&#8221; said Father Claude. &#8220;When we left
the council they were not unfriendly to us.
But in an hour it may be that they will renew
the torture. Until their hearts have been
touched by the Faith there are but two motives
behind the most of their actions, expediency
and revenge. But I think we may hope.
Brother de Lamberville has told of many
cases of torture where the right appeal has
brought a complete change.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they talked on, none having anything to
say, and yet each dreading the silences that
came so easily and hung over them so heavily.
They could see the council-house some distance
up the path. Its outlines were lost in
the shadows of the trees, but through the crevices
in the bark and logs came thin lines of
light, and a glow shone through the long roof
opening upon the smoke that hung in the still
air above it. Sometimes they could hear indistinctly
the voice of a speaker; but the words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
could not be distinguished. At other times
there was a low buzz of voices. The children
and women who had not been able to get into
the building could be seen moving about outside
shutting off a strip of light here and there.</p>
<p>Two braves came with some corn and smoked
meat. Menard set it down on a corner of the
blanket.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will eat, Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I am not hungry.
Thank you, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I may ask it,&ndash;&ndash;if I may insist,&ndash;&ndash;it is
really necessary, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached out, with a weary little gesture,
and took some of the corn.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you too, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>They ate in silence, and later went together
to the spring for a cool drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to make an effort to sleep,&#8221;
Menard said; and added, &#8220;if we can. Father,
you had better lie down. In a few hours, if
there is no word, I will wake you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not forget, M&#8217;sieu? You will not
let me sleep too long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The Captain smiled. &#8220;No, Father;
you shall take your turn at guard duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest said good-night, and went to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
knoll not far from the door. The maid had
settled back against the logs of the hut, and
was gazing at the trees. Menard sat in silence
for a few moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said at length, &#8220;I know
that it will be hard for you to rest until we have
heard; but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he hesitated, but she did not
help him, and he had to go on,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I wish you
would try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be of no use, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&ndash;&ndash;I know. But we have much to
keep in mind. It has been very hard. Any
one of us is likely to break. And you have not
been so used to this life as the Father and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; she said, still looking at the elm
branches that bent almost to the ground before
them, &#8220;but when I lie down, and close my eyes,
and let my mind go, it seems as if I could not
stand it. It is not bad now; I can be very
cool now. You see, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221; She turned
toward him with the trace of a smile. &#8220;But
when I let go&ndash;&ndash;perhaps you do not know how
it is; the thoughts that come, and the dreams,&ndash;&ndash;when
I am awake and yet not awake,&ndash;&ndash;and
the feeling that it is not worth while, this struggle,
even to what it may bring if we succeed.
It makes the night a torture, and the dread of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
another day is even worse. It is better to stay
awake; it is better even to break. Anything
is better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard looked down between his knees at
the ground. He did not understand what it
was that lay behind her words. He started to
speak, then stopped. After a little he found himself
saying words that came to his lips with no
effort; in fact, he did not seem able to check
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not right that I should be here near
you. I gave up that right to-night. I gave it
up yesterday. I have been proud, during these
years of fighting, that I was a soldier. I had
thought, too, that I was a man. It was hardly
a week ago that I rebuked that poor boy for
what I have since done myself. I promised
Major Provost that I would take you safely to
Frontenac. That I have failed is only a little
thing. I have said to you&ndash;&ndash;no, you must not
stop me. We have gone already beyond that
point. We understand now. I have tried to
be to you more than&ndash;&ndash;than I had a right to
be while you were in my care. Danton did
not know; Father Claude does not know. You
know, because I have told you. I have shown
you in a hundred ways.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, in a choking voice. &#8220;It is
my fault. I allowed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is nothing. It is not what you have
done. It is not even what you think. It is
what I shall think and know all my life,&ndash;&ndash;that
I have done the wrong thing. There are some
of us, Mademoiselle, who have no home, no ties
of family, no love, except for the work in which
we are slowly building up a good name and a
firm place. That is what I was. Do you know
what it is that makes up the life of such a
man? It is the little things, the acts of every
day and every week; and they must be honest
and loyal, or he will fail. I might have stayed
in Paris, I might even have found a place in
Quebec where I could wear a bright uniform,
and be close in the Governor&#8217;s favour. I chose
the other course. I have given a dozen years
to the harder work, only to fall within the week
from all that I had hoped,&ndash;&ndash;had thought myself
to be. And now, as I speak to you, I know
that I have lost; that if you should smile at me,
should put your hand in mine, everything that
I have been working for would be nothing to
me. You would be the only thing in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat motionless. He did not go on, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
yet each moment seemed to bring them closer
in understanding. After a little while she said
huskily:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cared&ndash;&ndash;you cared like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was not looking toward him, and she
could not see him slowly bow his head; but
there was an answer in his silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cared&ndash;&ndash;when you made the speech&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at the stalwart, bowed figure.
She was beginning to understand what he
had done, that in his pledge to the chiefs he
had triumphed over a love greater than she had
supposed a man could bear for a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;A soldier cannot always choose his way,&#8221;
he was saying. &#8220;I have never chosen mine.
It was the orders of my superior that brought
us here, that brought this suffering to you. If
it were not for these orders, the Onondagas
would be my friends, and because of that, your
friends. It has always been like this; I have
built up that others might tear down. I thought
for a few hours that something else was to come
to me. I should have known better. It was
when you took the daisy&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she raised her hand
and touched the withered flower. &#8220;I did not
reason. I knew I was breaking my trust, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
I did not care. After all, perhaps even that
was the best thing. It gave me strength and
hope to carry on the fight. It was you, then,&ndash;&ndash;not
New France. Now the dream is over,
and again it is New France. It must be that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it must be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had wild thoughts. I have meant
to ask you to let me hope, once this is over
and you safe at Frontenac. I could not believe
that what comes so easily to other men
is never to come to me. I cannot ask that
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, and a sudden glow came
into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she whispered, as if frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not,&#8221; he repeated, for an instant meeting
her gaze. Then he rose and stood before
her. &#8220;Because I have given an oath to bring
Captain la Grange to punishment. You heard
me. But you did not hear what I promised to
Father Claude. I have sworn that what the
Governor may refuse to do, I shall do myself.
I have set my hand against your family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could not help it, M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;you could
not help it,&#8221; she said. But the light was going
out of her eyes. It had been a moment of
weakness for both of them. She looked up at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
him, standing erect in the faint light, and the
sight of his square, broad shoulders seemed to
give her strength. He was the strong one; he
had always been the strong one. She rose and
leaned back against the logs. She found that
she could face him bravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is your cousin,&#8221; he had just said in a
dry voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he is my cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard was steadily recovering himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not give all up. You know that I
love you,&ndash;&ndash;I hope that you love me.&#8221; He
hesitated for an instant, but she gave no sign.
&#8220;We will keep the two flowers. We will always
think of this day, and yesterday. I have
no duty now but to get you safe to Frontenac;
until you are there I must not speak again.
As for the rest of it, we can only wait, and
trust that some day there may be some light.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not know? Father Claude has not
told you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in her voice brought him a step
nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that Captain la Grange is my
cousin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You did not know that I am to be his
wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood face to face, looking deep into
each other&#8217;s eyes, while a long minute dragged
by, and the rustling night sounds and the call
of the crickets came to their ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I did not know. May I
keep the flower, Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>She bowed her head. She could not speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked away. She saw him stop at the
knoll where the priest lay asleep on a bed of
boughs, and stand for a moment gazing down
at him. Then he went into the shadows.
From the crackling of the twigs she knew that
he was walking about among the trees. She
sank to the ground and listened to the crickets.
A frog bellowed in the valley; perhaps he had
been calling before&ndash;&ndash;she did not know.</p>
<p>She fell asleep, with her cheek resting against
a mossy log. She did not know when Menard
came back and stood for a long time looking at
her. He did not awaken Father Claude until
long after the time for changing the watch.</p>
<p>When he did, he walked up and down on the
path, holding the priest&#8217;s arm, and trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
speak. They had rounded the large maple
three times before he said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not tell me, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, my son?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Captain stopped, and drawing the priest
around, pointed toward the maid as she slept.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not tell me&ndash;&ndash;why we are taking
her to Frontenac.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. She asked it. We spoke of it only
once, that night on the river. She was confused,
and she asked me not to speak. She
does not know him. She has not seen him
since she was a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard said nothing. He was gripping
the priest&#8217;s arm, and gazing at the sleeping
maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was her father,&#8221; added Father Claude.</p>
<p>Menard&#8217;s hand relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Father.&#8221; He walked slowly
toward the bed on the knoll. And Father
Claude called softly after him:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, M&#8217;sieu. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard lay awake. He could see the priest
sitting by the door. He wondered if the maid
were sleeping. A late breeze came across the
valley, arousing the leaves and carrying a soft
whisper from tree to tree, until all the forest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
voices were joined. Lying on his side he
could see indistinctly the council-house. There
were still the lighted cracks; the Long House
was still in session. Their decision did not
now seem so vital a matter. The thought of
the maid&ndash;&ndash;that he was taking her to be the
wife of another, and that other La Grange&ndash;&ndash;had
taken the place of all other thoughts.</p>
<p>Later still came the buzz of many voices.
Dark forms were moving about the council-house.
Menard raised himself to his elbow,
and waited until he saw a group approaching
on the path, then he joined Father Claude.</p>
<p>The Big Throat led the little band of chiefs
to the hut. They stood, half a score of them,
in a semicircle, their blankets drawn close,
their faces, so far as could be seen in the dim
light, stern and impassive. Menard and the
priest stood erect and waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has pleased the Great Mountain that his
voice should be heard in the Long House of
the Iroquois,&#8221; said the Big Throat, in a low,
calm voice. &#8220;His voice is gentle as the breeze
and yet as strong as the wind. The Great
Mountain has before promised many things to
the Iroquois. Some of the promises he has
broken, some he has kept. But the Onondagas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
know that there is no man who keeps all his
promises. They once thought they knew such
a man, but they were mistaken. White men,
Indians,&ndash;&ndash;all speak at night with a strong voice,
in the morning with a weak voice. Each draws
his words sometimes off the top of his mind,
where the truth and the strong words do not lie.
The Onondagas are not children. They know
the friend from the enemy. And they know,
though he may sometimes fail them, that the
Great Mountain is their friend, their father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard bowed slowly, facing the chief with
self-control as firm as his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;They know,&#8221; the Big Throat continued,
&#8220;that the Indian has not always kept the faith
with the white man. And then it is that the
Great Mountain has been a kind father. If he
thinks it right that our brothers, the Senecas,
should meet with punishment for breaking the
peace promised to the white man by the Long
House, the Onondagas are not the children to
say to their father, &#8216;We care not if our brother
has done wrong; we will cut off the hand that
holds the whip of punishment.&#8217; The Onondagas
are men. They say to the father, &#8216;We care
not who it is that has done wrong. Though he
be our next of blood, let him be punished.&#8217; This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
is the word of the council to the Big Buffalo
who speaks with his father&#8217;s voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well as he knew the Iroquois temperament,
Menard could not keep an expression of admiration
from his eyes. He knew what this speech
meant,&ndash;&ndash;that the Big Throat alone saw far into
the future, saw that in the conflict between red
and white, the redman must inevitably lose
unless he crept close under the arm that was
raised to strike him. It was no sense of justice
that prompted the Big Throat&#8217;s words; it was
the vision of one of the shrewdest statesmen,
white or red, who had yet played a part in the
struggles for possession of the New World.
Greatest of all, only a master could have convinced
that hot-blooded council that peace was
the safest course. The chief went on:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo has spoken well to the
council. He has told the chiefs that he has not
been a traitor to the brothers who have for so
long believed that his words were true words.
The Big Buffalo is a pine tree that took root in
the lands of the Onondagas many winters ago.
From these lands and these waters, and the sun
and winds that give life to the corn and the
trees of the Onondagas, he drew his sap and his
strength. Can we then believe that this pine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
tree which we planted and which has grown
tall and mighty before our eyes, is not a pine
tree at all? When a quick-tongued young
brave, who has not known the young tree as we
have, comes to the council and says that this
Big Buffalo, this pine tree, is not a pine but an
elm with slippery bark, are we to believe him?
Are we to drop from our minds what our hearts
and eyes have long known, to forget what we
have believed? My brothers of the Long House
say no. They know that the pine tree is a pine
tree. It may be that in the haze of the distance
pine and elm look alike to young eyes; but
what a chief has seen, he has seen; what he
has known, he has known. The Big Buffalo
speaks the truth to his Onondaga brothers, and
with another sun he shall be free to go to his
white brothers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Throat has a faithful heart,&#8221; said
Menard, quietly. &#8220;He knows that the voice of
Onontio is the voice of right and strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The chiefs of the Onondagas and Cayugas
will sit quietly before their houses with their
eyes turned toward the lands beyond the great
lake, waiting for the whisper that shall come
with the speed of the winds over forests and
waters to tell them that the white man has kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
his promise. When the dog who robbed our
villages of a hundred brave warriors has been
slain, then shall they know that the Big Buffalo
is what they have believed him to be, their
brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the maid and the holy Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are free. The chiefs are sorry that
a foolish brave has captured the white man&#8217;s
squaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard and Father Claude bowed again, and
the chiefs turned and strode away. The priest
smiled gently after them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, M&#8217;sieu, we may rest quietly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You lie down, Father; it will not be
necessary to watch now, and anyway I am not
likely to sleep much.&#8221; He walked back to the
bed on the knoll, leaving the priest to stretch
out across the doorway.</p>
<p>The elder bushes and briers crowded close to
the little clearing behind the hut, and Menard,
lying on his side with his face close to the
ground, watched the clusters of leaves as they
gently rustled. He rolled half over and stared
up at the bits of sky that showed through the
trees. It seemed as if the great world were a
new thing, as if these trees and bushes and
reaches of tufted grass were a part of a new life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
Before, they had played their part in his rugged
life without asking for recognition; but to-night
they came into his thoughts with their sympathy,
and he wondered that all this great
world of summer green and winter white, and
of blue and green and lead-coloured water could
for so long have influenced him without consciousness
on his part. But his life had left
little time for such thoughts; to-night he was
unstrung.</p>
<p>Over the noise of the leaves and the trickle
of the spring sounded a rustle. It was not loud,
but it was a new sound, and his eyes sought the
bushes. The noise came, and stopped; came,
and stopped. Evidently someone was creeping
slowly toward the hut; but the sound was
on the farther side of him, so that he could
reach the maid&#8217;s side before whoever was
approaching could cross the clearing.</p>
<p>For a time the noise died altogether. Then,
after a space, his eyes, sweeping back and forth
along the edge of the brush, rested on a bright
bit of metal that for an instant caught the light
of the sky, probably a weapon or a head ornament.
Menard was motionless. Finally an
Indian stepped softly out and stood beside a
tree. When he began to move forward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
Captain recognized Tegakwita, and he spoke his
name.</p>
<p>The Indian came rapidly over the grass with
his finger at his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not speak loud,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Do
not wake the holy Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you come creeping upon my house
at night, like a robber?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita is sad for his sister. His heart
will not let him go among men about the village;
it will not let his feet walk on the common
path.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita seeks the Big Buffalo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It cannot be for an honest reason. You
lay behind the bush. You saw me here and
thought me asleep, but you did not approach
honestly. You crept through the shadows like
a Huron.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita&#8217;s night eyes are not his day
eyes. He could not see who the sleeping
man was. When he heard the voice, he came
quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard looked at the musket that rested in
the Indian&#8217;s hand, at the hatchet and knife that
hung from his belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are heavily armed, Tegakwita. Is it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
for the war-path or the hunt? Do Onondaga
warriors carry their weapons from house to
house in their own village?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian made a little gesture of impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita has no house. His house has
been dishonoured. He lives under the trees,
and carries his house with him. All that he
has is in his hand or his belt. The Big Buffalo
speaks strangely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard said nothing for a moment. He
looked up, with a keen gaze, at the erect figure
of the Indian. Finally he said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Tegakwita. Tell me why you
came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Tegakwita cannot rest himself until
his sister has reached the Happy Hunting-Ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, do as you like. But waste no
more time. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo has been an Onondaga.
He knows the city in the valley where the
dead sit in their graves. It is there that my
sister lies, by an open grave, waiting for the
farewell word of him who alone is left to
say farewell to her. Tegakwita&#8217;s Onondaga
brothers will not gather at the grave of a girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
who has given up her nation for a white dog.
But he can ask the Big Buffalo, who brought
the white dog to our village, to come to the
side of the grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your memory is bad, Tegakwita. It was
not I who brought the white brave. It was
you who brought him, his two hands tied with
thongs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian stood, without replying, looking
down at him with brilliant, staring eyes.</p>
<p>Menard spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want me to go with you. You slip
through the bushes like a snake, with your
musket and your knife and your hatchet, to
ask me to go with you to the grave of your
sister. Do I speak rightly, Tegakwita?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo has understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard slowly rose and looked into the
Indian&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no weapons, Tegakwita. The chiefs
who have set me free have not yet returned the
musket which was taken from me. It is dangerous
to go at night through the forest without
a weapon. Give me your hatchet and I will
go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tegakwita&#8217;s lip curled almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Chief is afraid of the night?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>Menard, too, looked scornful. He coolly
waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo cannot face the dead without
a hatchet in his hand?&#8221; said Tegakwita.</p>
<p>Menard suddenly sprang forward and
snatched the hatchet from the Indian&#8217;s belt.
It was a surprise, and the struggle was brief.
Tegakwita was thrown a step backward. He
hesitated between struggling for the hatchet
and striking with the musket; before he had
fully recovered and dropped the musket,
Menard had leaped back and stood facing
him with the hatchet in his right hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I will go with you to the city of the
dead, Tegakwita.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian&#8217;s breath was coming quickly, and
he stood with clenched fists, taken aback by the
Captain&#8217;s quickness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, I am ready. Pick up your musket.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Tegakwita stooped, Menard glanced
toward the hut. The priest lay asleep before
the door. It was better to get this madman
away than to leave him free to prowl about the
hut.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>THE BAD DOCTOR.</h3>
</div>
<p>At the edge of the thicket they stopped and
stood face to face, each waiting for the
other to pass ahead. Tegakwita slightly bowed,
with an unconscious imitation of the Frenchmen
he had seen at Fort Frontenac and Montreal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass on,&#8221; said Menard, sternly. &#8220;You
know the trail, Tegakwita; I do not. It is you
who must lead the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian was sullen, but he yielded,
plunging forward between the bushes, and
now and then, in the shadow of some tree,
glancing furtively over his shoulder. His
manner, the suspicion that showed plainly in
the nervous movements of his head, in every
motion as he glided through thicket, glade, or
strip of forest, told Menard that he had chosen
well to take the second place. His fingers
closed firmly about the handle of the hatchet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
That he could throw at twenty paces to the
centre of a sapling, no one knew better than
Tegakwita.</p>
<p>The city of the dead lay in a hollow at ten
minutes&#8217; walk from the village. Generations
ago the trees had been cleared, and no bush or
sapling had been allowed a foothold on this
ground. The elms and oaks and maples threw
their shadows across the broad circle, and each
breath of wind set them dancing over the
mounds where many an hundred skeletons
crouched side by side, under the grass-grown
heaps of earth, their rusted knives and hatchets
and their mouldy blankets by their sides. No
man came here, save when a new heap of yellow
earth lay fresh-turned in the sun, and a
long line of dancing, wailing redmen, led by
their howling doctors, followed some body that
had come to claim its seat among the skeletons.</p>
<p>Tegakwita paused at the edge of the clearing,
and looked around with that furtive quickness.
Menard came slowly to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will take your weapons to the grave?&#8221;
asked Menard, very quietly, but with a suggestion
that the other understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Tegakwita has no place for his weapons.
He must carry them where he goes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can leave them here. The leaves will
hide them. I will put the hatchet under this
log.&#8221; He made a motion of dropping the
hatchet, closely watching the Indian; then he
straightened, for Tegakwita&#8217;s right hand held
the musket, and his left rested lightly on his
belt, not a span from his long knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Chief knows the danger of leaving
weapons to tempt the young braves. He
finds it easy to take the chance with Tegakwita&#8217;s
hatchet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Menard, sternly. &#8220;Lead
the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked slowly between the mounds.
Menard looked carefully about, but in the
uncertain light he could see no sign of a
new opening in any of them. When they
had passed the centre he stopped, and said
quietly:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the grave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is beyond, close to the great oak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>They went on. The great oak was in a
dense, deep-shadowed place, at the edge of the
circle. A little to one side, close to the crowding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
thicket, was a small, new mound. Looking
now at Tegakwita, Menard could see that his
front was stained with the soil. Probably he
had spent the day working on the mound for
his sister. While Menard stood at one side, he
went to a bush that encroached a yard on the
sacred ground and drew out a number of presents,
with necessary articles and provisions to
stay the soul on its long journey to the Happy
Hunting-Ground. It was at the end of Menard&#8217;s
tongue to repeat Tegakwita&#8217;s remark about
hiding the weapons, but he held back and
stood silently waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the Indian.</p>
<p>He parted the bushes, drew away a heavy covering
of boughs, and there, wrapped in Tegakwita&#8217;s
finest blanket, lay the body of the Indian
girl. Menard stood over it, looking down with
a sense of pity he had never before felt for an
Indian. He could not see her face, for it was
pressed to the ground, but the clotted scalp
showed indistinctly in the shadow. He suddenly
raised, his eyes to Tegakwita, who stood
opposite.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done with the white brave?&#8221;
he said in fierce, low tones. &#8220;What have you
done with him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>Tegakwita raised one arm and swept it about
in a quarter circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask the vultures that come when a man
falls, ask the beasts that wait for everyone, ask
the dogs of the village. They can tell you,
not I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard&#8217;s hands closed tightly, and a wild
desire came to him to step across the body and
choke the man who had killed Danton; but in
a moment he was himself. He had nothing to
gain by violence. And after all, the Indian
had done no more than was, in his eyes, right.
He bent down; and together they carried the
body to the grave, close at hand. Tegakwita
placed her sitting upright in the hole he had
dug. By her side he placed the pots and dishes
and knives which she had used in preparing the
food they two had eaten. He set the provisions
before her and in her lap; and drawing a twist
of tobacco from his bosom, he laid it at her feet
to win her the favour and kindness of his own
Manitou on her journey. After each gift he
stood erect, looking up at the sky with his arms
stretched out above his head; and at these
moments his simple dignity impressed Menard.
But there were other moments, when, in stooping,
Tegakwita would glance about with nervous,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
shifting eyes, as if fearing some interruption.
His musket was always in his hand or
by his side. Menard took it that he still feared
the hatchet.</p>
<p>Then at last the ceremony was done, and
the Indian with his bare hands threw the earth
over the hole in the mound. Still looking nervously
from bush to bush, his hands began to
move more slowly; then he paused, and sat by
the mound, looking up with a hesitancy that
recognized the need of an explanation for the
delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita&#8217;s arms are weary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they?&#8221; said Menard, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita has not slept for many suns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither have I.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian started as a rustle came from the
forest. Menard watched him curiously. The
whole proceeding was too unusual to be easily
understood. Tegakwita&#8217;s nervous manner, his
request that the Captain accompany him to the
mound, the weapons that never left his side,&ndash;&ndash;these
might be the signs of a mind driven to
madness by his sister&#8217;s act; but Menard did not
recollect, from his own observation of the Iroquois
character, that love for a sister was a
marked trait among the able-bodied braves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Perhaps it was delay that he sought. At this
thought Menard quietly moved farther from the
undergrowth. Tegakwita&#8217;s quick eyes followed
the movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;the night is nearly
gone. I cannot wait longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita has worked hard. His heart is
sick, his body lame. Will the Big Buffalo
help his Onondaga brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian rose with too prompt relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your muscles need only the promise of
help to give them back their spring, Tegakwita.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Chief speaks with a biting
tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been speaking with a lying
tongue. You think I do not know why you have
brought me here; you think I do not understand
the evil thoughts that fill your mind.
You are a coward, Tegakwita. But you will
not succeed to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ill-concealed fright that came into the
Indian&#8217;s face and manner told Menard that he
was not wide of the mark. He began to understand.
Tegakwita wished to get him at work
and off his guard,&ndash;&ndash;the rest would be simple.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
And as Menard well knew, more than one
brave of the Onondagas, who had known him
both as friend and enemy, would shrink when
the moment came to attack the Big Buffalo
single-handed, even though taking him at a
disadvantage. Now Tegakwita was hesitating,
and struggling to keep his eyes from the
thicket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will help you. We will close this
matter now, and go back to the village where
your cowardly hands will be tied by fear of
your chiefs. Drop your musket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo speaks in anger. Does he
think to disarm Tegakwita that he may kill
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay your musket on the ground before us.
Then I will drop the hatchet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tegakwita stepped around the grave, and
leaning the musket across a stone stood by it.
Menard&#8217;s voice was full of contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not fear. The Big Buffalo keeps
his word.&#8221; He tossed the hatchet over the
grave, and stood unarmed. &#8220;Drop your
knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tegakwita hesitated. Menard took a step
forward, and the knife fell to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come. We will work side by side.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
was surprised at Tegakwita&#8217;s slinking manner.
He wondered if this Indian could by
some strange accident have been given a temperament
so fine that sorrow could unman him.
To the Iroquois, gifted as they were with reasoning
power, life held little sentiment. Curiously
enough, as Menard stood in the light of
the young moon watching the warrior come
slowly around the grave, which still showed
above the earth the head and shoulders of the
dead girl, he found himself calling up the rare
instances he had known of a real affection between
Indians.</p>
<p>Tegakwita stood by him, and without a word
they stooped and set to work, side by side,
scraping the earth with their fingers over the
body. Tegakwita found a dozen little ways to
delay. Menard steadily lost patience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tegakwita has forgotten,&#8221; said the Indian,
standing up; &#8220;he has not offered the present
to his sister&#8217;s Oki.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Menard, roughly.</p>
<p>Tegakwita&#8217;s voice trembled, as if he knew
that he was pressing the white man too far.</p>
<p>&#8220;The grave must be opened. It will not
take long.&#8221;</p>
<p>It came to Menard in a flash. The many delays,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
the anxious glances toward the thicket,&ndash;&ndash;these
meant that others were coming. Something
delayed them; Tegakwita must hold the
Big Buffalo till they arrived. With never a
word Menard sprang over the grave; but the
Indian was quicker, and his hand was the first
on the musket. Then they fought, each struggling
to free his hands from the other&#8217;s grasp,
rolling over and over,&ndash;&ndash;now half erect, tramping
on the soft mound, now wrestling on the
harder ground below. At last Menard, as they
whirled and tumbled past the weapons, snatched
the knife. Tegakwita caught his wrist, and
then it was nigh to stabbing his own thigh as
they fought for it. Once he twisted his hand
and savagely buried the blade in the Indian&#8217;s
side. Tegakwita caught his breath and rallied,
and the blood of the one was on them both.
At last a quick wrench bent the Indian&#8217;s wrist
back until it almost snapped,&ndash;&ndash;Menard thought
that it had,&ndash;&ndash;and the stained blade went home
once, and again, and again, until the arms that
had clung madly about the white man slipped
off, and lay weakly on the ground.</p>
<p>Menard was exhausted. The dirt and blood
were in his hair and eyes and ears. He was
rising stiffly to his knees when the rush of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
Indians came from the bushes. He could not
see them clearly,&ndash;&ndash;could hardly hear them,&ndash;&ndash;though
he fought until a musket-stock swung
against his head and stretched him on the
ground.</p>
<p>When he recovered they were standing
about him, half a score of them, waiting to
see if he still had life. He raised a bruised
arm to wipe his eyes, but a rough hand caught
it and drew a thong tightly about his wrists.
Slowly his senses awakened, and he could see
indistinctly the silent forms,&ndash;&ndash;some standing
motionless, others walking slowly about. It
was strange. His aching head had not the
wit to meet with the situation. Then they
jerked him to his feet, and with a stout brave
at each elbow and others crowding about on
every side, he was dragged off through the
bushes.</p>
<p>For a long time the silent party pushed forward.
They were soon clear of the forest,
passing through rich wild meadows that lifted
the scent of clover, the fresher for the dew that
lay wet underfoot. There were other thickets
and other forests, and many a reach of meadow,
all rolling up and down over the gentle hills.
Menard tried to gather his wits, but his head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
reeled; and the struggle to keep his feet moving
steadily onward was enough to hold his
mind. He knew that he should watch the
trail closely, to know where they were taking
him, but he was not equal to the effort. At
last the dawn came, gray and depressing, creeping
with deadly slowness on the trail of the retreating
night. The sky was dull and heavy,
and a mist clung about the party, leaving little
beads of moisture on deerskin coats and
fringed leggings and long, brown musket barrels.
The branches drooped from the trees,
blurred by the mist and the half dark into
strange shapes along the trail.</p>
<p>The day was broad awake when Menard
gave way. His muscles had been tried to the
limit of his endurance during these many desperate
days and sleepless nights that he had
thought to be over. He fell loosely forward.
For a space they dragged him, but the burden
was heavy, and the chief ordered a rest. The
band of warriors scattered about to sleep under
the trees, leaving a young brave to watch the
Big Buffalo, who slept motionless where they
had dropped him in the long grass close at
hand. On every side were hills, shielding
them from the view of any chance straggler
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
from the Onondaga villages, unless he should
clamber down the short slopes and search for
them in the mist. A stream tumbled by, not
a dozen yards from Menard and his yawning
guardian.</p>
<p>When he awoke, the mist had thinned, but
the sky showed no blue. Beneath the gray
stretch that reached from hill crest to hill crest,
light foaming clouds scudded across from east
to west, though there was little wind near the
ground. The Captain listened for a time to
the noise of the stream before looking about.
He changed his position, and rheumatic pains
shot through his joints. For the second time
in his life he realized that he was growing old;
and with this thought came another. What
sort of a soldier was he if he could not pass
through such an experience without paying
the old man&#8217;s penalty. To be sure his head
was battered and bruised, and scattered over
his shoulders and arms and hips were a dozen
small wounds to draw in the damp from the
grass, but he did not think of these. In his
weak, half-awake state, he was discouraged,
with the feeling that the best of his life was
past. And the thought that he, a worn old
soldier, could have dreamed what he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
dreamed of the maid and her love sank down
on his heart like a weight. But this thought
served another purpose: to think of the maid
was to think of her danger; and this was to be
the alert soldier again, with a plan for every
difficulty as long as he had life in his body.
And so, before the mood could drag him down,
he was himself again.</p>
<p>Most of the Indians were asleep, sprawling
about under the trees near the water. The
warrior guarding Menard appeared to be little
more than a youth. He sat with his knees
drawn up and his head bowed, his blanket
pulled close around him, and his oily black
hair tangled about his eyes. Menard lay on
his back looking at the Indian through half-closed
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said in a low, distinct voice,
&#8220;you have me now, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian gave him a quick glance, but
made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all right, my brother. Do not turn your
eyes to me, and nothing will be seen. I can
speak quietly. A nod of your head will tell me
if anyone comes near. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the little eyes squinted through the
hanging locks of hair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You do understand? Very well. You
know who I am? I am the Big Buffalo. I
killed half a score of your bravest warriors in
their own village. Do you think these thongs
can hold the Big Buffalo, who never has been
held by thongs, who is the hardest fighter
and the boldest hunter of all the lands from
the Mohawk to the Great River of the Illinois?
Listen, I will tell you how many
canoes of furs the Big Buffalo has in the
north country; I will tell you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian&#8217;s head nodded almost imperceptibly.
A yawning brave was walking slowly
along the bank of the stream, gathering wood
for a fire. He passed to a point a few rods
below the prisoner, then came back and disappeared
among the trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; said Menard, keeping his
voice at such a low pitch that the guard had to
bend his head slightly toward him, &#8220;of the
great bales of beaver that are held safe in the
stores of the Big Buffalo. Does my brother
understand? Does he see that these bales are
for him, that he will be as rich as the greatest
chief among all the chiefs of the Long House?
No brave shall have such a musket,&ndash;&ndash;with a
long, straight barrel that will send a ball to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
the shoulder of a buffalo farther than the
flight of three arrows. His blanket shall be
the brightest in Onondaga; his many clothes,
his knives, his hatchets, his collars of wampum
shall have no equal. He can buy the
prettiest wives in the nation. Does my brother
understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>The fire had been lighted, and a row of wild
hens turned slowly on wooden spits over the
flames. One by one the warriors were rousing
and stirring about among the trees. There
were shouts and calls, and the grumbling talk
of the cooks as they held the long spits and
turned their faces away from the smoke, which
rose but slowly in the damp, heavy air. Menard
lay with his eyes closed, as if asleep; even
his lips hardly moved as he talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother must think quickly, for the time
is short. All that I promise he will have, if he
will be a friend to the Big Buffalo. And every
Onondaga knows that the word of the Big
Buffalo is a word that has never been broken.
My brother will be a friend. He will watch
close, and to-night, when the dark has come,
he will let his knife touch the thongs that
hold the White Chief captive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian&#8217;s face was without expression.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
Menard watched him closely, but could not
tell whether his offer was taking effect. What
he had no means of knowing was that since the
battle at the hut, and the short fight in the
council-house, the younger braves had centred
their superstitions on him. It was thought
that his body was occupied by some bad spirit
that gave him the strength of five men, and that
he had been sent to their village by a devil to
lure the warriors into the hands of the French.
These were not the open views that would have
been heard at a council; they were the fears of
the untried warriors, who had not the vision
to understand the diplomacy of the chiefs, nor
the position in the village to give them a public
hearing. They had talked together in low
tones, feeding the common fear, until a few
words from the Long Arrow had aroused them
into action. And so this guard was between
two emotions: the one a lust for wealth and
position in the tribe, common to every Indian
and in most cases a stronger motive than any
of the nobler sentiments; the other an unreasoning
fear of this &#8220;bad doctor,&#8221; the fear
that to aid him or to accept furs from him
would poison the ears of his own Oki, and
destroy his chance of a name and wealth during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
his life, and of a long, glorious hunt after
death.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother shall come with me to the land
of the white men, where there is no trouble,&ndash;&ndash;where
he shall have a great lodge like the white
chiefs, with coloured pictures in gold frames, and
slaves to prepare his food. He shall be a great
chief among white men and redmen, and his
stores shall be filled to the doors with furs of
beaver and seal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard&#8217;s voice was so low and deliberate
that the Indian did not question his statements.
He was tempted more strongly than he had
ever been tempted before, but with the desire
grew the fear of the consequences. As for the
Captain, he was clutching desperately at this
slender chance that lay to his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given my brother his choice of
greater power than was ever before offered to
a youth who has yet to win his name. The
stroke of a knife will do it. No one shall
know, for the Big Buffalo can be trusted. My
brother has it before him to be a red chief or
a white chief, as he may wish. The warriors
are near,&ndash;&ndash;the day grows bright; he must
speak quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a call from the group by the fire,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
and the young Indian gave a little start, and
slowly rising, walked away, yielding his place
as guard to an older man. Menard rolled over
and pressed his face to the ground as if weary;
he could then watch the youth through the
grass as he moved to the fire, but in a moment
he lost sight of him. The new guard was a
stern-faced brave, and his appearance promised
no help; so the Captain, having done all that
could be done at the moment, tried to get
another sleep, struggling to put thoughts of
the maid from his mind. Perhaps, after all,
she was safe at the village.</p>
<p>Meantime the youth, after a long struggle
with the temptings of the bad doctor, yielded
to his superstition, and sought the Long Arrow,
who lay on the green bank of the stream. In
a few moments the story was told, and the
chief, with a calm face but with twinkling eyes,
came to the prisoner and stood looking down
at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Chief is glad to be with his
Onondaga brothers?&#8221; he said in his quiet
voice.</p>
<p>Menard slowly raised his eyes, and looked
coolly at the chief without replying.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tongue of the Big Buffalo is weary perhaps?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
It has moved so many times to tell the
Onondaga what is not true, that now it asks
for rest. The Long Arrow is kind. He will
not seek to move it again. For another sleep
it shall lie at rest; then it may be that our
braves shall find a way to stir it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard rolled over, with an expression of
contempt, and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Long Arrow was sorry that his white
brother was disappointed at the torture. Perhaps
he will have better fortune after he has
slept again. Already have the fires been lighted
that shall warm the heart of the White Chief.
And he shall have friends to brighten him.
His squaw, too, shall feel the glow of the roaring
fire, and the gentle hands of the Onondaga
warriors, who do not forget the deaths of their
own blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard lay still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another sleep, my brother, and the great
White Chief who speaks with the voice of
Onontio shall be with his friends. He shall
hear the sweet voice of his young squaw
through the smoke that shall be her garment.
He shall hear the prayers of his holy Father
by his side, and shall know that his spirit is
safe with the Great Spirit who is not strong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
enough to give him his life when the Long
Arrow takes it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was still a mad hope that the chief
spoke lies, that the maid and Father Claude
were safe. True or false, the Long Arrow
would surely talk thus; for the Iroquois were
as skilled in the torments of the mind as of
the body. He was conscious that the keen
voice was going on, but he did not follow
what it said. Again he was going over and
over in his mind all the chances of escape.
It might be that the youth had been moved
by his offer. But at that moment he heard
the Long Arrow saying:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220; ... Even before his death the Big Buffalo
must lie as he has always lied. His tongue
knows not the truth. He thinks to deceive
our young braves with talk of his furs and
his lodges and his power in the land of the
white men. But our warriors know the truth.
They know that the Big Buffalo has no store
of furs, no great lodges,&ndash;&ndash;that he lives in
the woods with only a stolen musket, where he
can by his lies capture the peaceful hunters of
the Onondagas to make them the slaves of his
Chief-Across-the-Water.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>AT THE LONG LAKE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Menard again dropped to sleep. When
the day had nearly reached its middle, he
was aroused by two warriors, who pulled him
roughly to his feet. The band had evidently
been astir for some moments. A few braves
were extinguishing the fire with clumps of sod,
while the others packed in their blankets what
had been left from the morning meal, or looked
to the spots of rust which the damp had
brought to knives and muskets. The Long
Arrow came over to inspect the thongs that
held Menard&#8217;s wrists; he had not forgotten
his attack on his guards on the morning of the
torture. And with a precaution that brought
a half smile to the prisoner&#8217;s face, he posted
a stout warrior on each side, in addition to
those before and behind. Then they set out
over the hills, wading through a great tumbling
meadow where their feet sank deep into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
the green and yellow and white that June had
spread over the open lands of the Iroquois.
Overhead the sky, though still clouded, was
breaking, giving little glimpses of clear blue.</p>
<p>As they neared the crest of the first hill, the
Captain looked back over his shoulder. The
sun had at last broken through to the earth,
and a great band of yellow light was moving
swiftly across the valley. Before it, all the
ground was sombre in its dark green and its
heavy moisture; behind lay a stretch of golden
sunshine, rounding over the farther hills in
great billows of grass and flowers and clustering
trees, glistening with dew and glowing with
the young health of the summer. Up the hillside
came the sunlight; and then in a moment
it had passed them, and the air was warm and
sweet.</p>
<p>Menard looked at the sun and then back
across the valley to get his direction. He
saw that the party was moving a little to the
south of west. This line of march should take
them through the Cayuga country,&ndash;&ndash;a natural
move on the part of the Long Arrow, for the
Cayugas were closer to the scene of the fighting
than the Onondagas, and therefore would
be less likely to interfere with the persecution
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
of a Frenchman, particularly before their chiefs
should return from the council.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon they came to a slow-moving
stream, the outlet of an inland lake.
By the basin-shape of the end of the lake, he
recognized it as one that lay directly between
Onondaga and the Long Lake of the Cayugas.
On the bank of the little river, under the
matted foliage, the chief signalled a halt, and
the warriors threw themselves on the ground.
Menard lay at the foot of a beech whose roots
dipped in the water, and for the hundredth
time since the sun had risen he cast about for
some chance at escape. The thongs about his
wrists were tied by skilful hands. He tried to
reach the knot with his fingers, but could not.
His guards were alert to every motion; they
lay on either side, and he could not lift his
eyes without meeting the sullen glance of one
or the other. He was about ready to submit,
trusting to his wits to seize the first opportunity
that should come; for after all, to worry
would strain his nerves, and now, if at any
time, his nerves and his strength were needed.
When at last he reached this point of view, he
lay back on the weed-grown earth and went to
sleep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>An hour later he was aroused for another
start. Night came while they were on the
way, but they pushed steadily forward, and
within a few hours they reached the Long
Lake. Instead of stopping, however, the Long
Arrow headed to the south along the bank of
the lake. For a space it was hard going
through the interwoven bushes and briers that
tore even Menard&#8217;s tough skin. The moon
was in the sky, and here and there he caught
glimpses of the lake lying still and bright.
They saw no signs of life save for the flitting
bats, and the owls that called weirdly through
the reaches of the forest. After another hour
they found a trail which led them down close
to the water, and at last to a half-cleared space,
rank and wild with weed and thistle, and with
rotting heaps where lay the trunks of trees,
felled a generation earlier. Scattered about
the outer edge of the clearing, close to the
circle of trees, were a few bark huts, with
roofs sagging and doors agape. One or two
were rivalled in height by the weeds that
choked their windows. As Menard stood
between his guards under the last tree on the
trail, looking at the deserted village where the
frightened bats rose and wheeled, and the moonlight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
streamed on broken roofs, he began to
understand. The Long Arrow had found a
place where he could carry out his vengeance
undisturbed.</p>
<p>Other forms had risen from the weeds to
greet the party. Looking more closely, Menard
saw that a group of Indians were dragging logs
for a fire. Evidently this was a rendezvous for
two or more bands. He tried to count the dim
forms, and found them somewhat less than a
score in all. Perhaps the Long Arrow had
found it not easy to raise a large party to
defy the will of the council concerning the
White Chief; but he had enough, and already
the brandy was beginning to flow,&ndash;&ndash;the first
stage of the orgie which should take up the
rest of the night, and perhaps the day to follow.
The Long Arrow and his party at once joined
in the drinking. Confident that they would
not this time be interrupted, they would probably
use all deliberation in preparing for the
torture.</p>
<p>A rough meal was soon ready, and all fell to.
Nothing was set apart for the prisoner; though
had he been weak they would have fed him to
stay him for the torture. One of his guardians,
in mock pity, threw him a bone to which a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
meat clung. He asked that his hands be loosed,
or at least tied in front of his body, but his
request brought jeers from the little group about
him. Seeing that there was no hope of aid, he
rolled over and gnawed the bone where it lay
on the ground. The warriors laughed again,
and one kicked it away; but Menard crawled
after it, and this time was not disturbed. A
little later, two other Indians came from the
fire, and after a talk with his guards, ordered
him to his feet and led him to one of the
huts. The door was of rude boards, hung
on wooden hinges, and now held in place by a
short log. One brave kicked away the log, and
Menard was thrown inside with such force that
he fell headlong.</p>
<p>Through an opening in the roof came a wide
beam of moonlight. He looked up, and at
first thought he was alone; then he saw two
figures crouching against the rear wall. His
own face and head were so covered with dust
and blood that he could not have been recognized
for a white man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he said in Iroquois.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain!&#8221; came in a startled voice that he
knew for Father Claude&#8217;s; and a little gasp of
relief from the other figure brought a thrill of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
joy. He tried to raise himself, but in an instant
they had come to him and were laughing and
sobbing and speaking his name. While Father
Claude seized his shoulders to lift him, the maid
fell on her knees, and with her teeth tried to cut
the thongs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Father,&#8221; she said in a mumbled voice,
without pausing in her work; &#8220;wait a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard could feel her warm tears dropping
on his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not, Mademoiselle,&#8221; said the
priest. &#8220;You must let me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head, and worked faster, until
the thongs fell away and she could rub with her
own torn hands the Captain&#8217;s wrists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now he may arise, Father. See&ndash;&ndash;see what
they have done to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard laughed. All the weight that had
pressed on his heart had lifted at the sound of
her voice and the touch of her hands. The
laugh lingered until he was on his feet, and the
three stood close together in the patch of moonlight
and looked each into the other&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;not
speaking, because there was no word so
complete as the relief that had come to them
all; a relief so great, and a bond so strong that
during all the time they should live thereafter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
through other days and other times, even across
the seas in lands where much should be about
them to draw a mist over the past, the moment
would always be close in their memories,&ndash;&ndash;it
would stand out above all other deeds and other
moments. Then the Captain held out his hands,
and they each took one in a long clasp that told
them all to hope, that stirred a new, daring
thought in each heart. Father Claude at last
turned away with shining eyes. The maid stood
looking up at this soldier whom she trusted, and
a little sigh passed her lips. Then she too
turned, and to cover her thoughts she hummed
a gay air that Menard had heard the trumpeters
play at Quebec.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us, M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; she said abruptly, &#8220;what is
it? How did it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the Long Arrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we thought,&#8221; said Father Claude; &#8220;but
he was not with the party that brought us
here, and we could not know. They came
while we were sleeping, and bound our mouths
so that we could not scream. I was at
fault, I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Father. You cannot say that. I left
you. I should have been at your side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell us about it, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221; asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
the maid. She was leaning against the bark
wall, looking at the two men.</p>
<p>Menard dropped to the ground, and in a quiet
voice gave them the story of his capture. The
priest rested near him on the broken-down bench
that slanted against one wall. As the story
grew, the maid came over and sat at the Captain&#8217;s
feet where she could watch his face as he
talked. When he reached the account of the
fight at the grave, he paused and looked at her
upturned face. Then he went on, but he did
not take up the tale where he had dropped it.
He could not tell her of Tegakwita&#8217;s end. As
he went on to the fight with the Long Arrow&#8217;s
band and the flight through the hill country, he
thought that she had missed nothing; but when
he had finished she said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Tegakwita, M&#8217;sieu? Did he come
with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Menard replied; &#8220;he did not come. I
killed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had not meant to let the words come out
so brutally. And now, as he saw the frightened
look, almost of horror, come into her eyes, he
suffered in a way that would not have been possible
before he had known this maid. He read
her thoughts,&ndash;&ndash;that she herself was the cause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
of a double tragedy,&ndash;&ndash;and it for the moment
unmanned him. When he could look at her
again, she was more nearly herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, M&#8217;sieu. There is more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. There is no more, except that I am
here with you. But of yourselves? You have
told me nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have told you all there is to tell,&#8221; said
Father Claude. &#8220;We were taken while we
slept. They have come rapidly, but otherwise
they have not been unkind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have had food?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must think now,&#8221; Menard said abruptly;
&#8220;we must put our wits together. It is late in
the night, and we should be free before dawn.
Have you thought of any way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the priest, slowly, &#8220;we have
thought of one. Teganouan is with our party.
At the first he tried to keep out of sight, but
of course he could not, once we were on the
way. He was a long time at the Mission of
St. Francis, and I at one time hoped that he
would prove a true believer. It was drink that
led him away from us,&ndash;&ndash;an old weakness with
him. This morning, when he passed me, I
knew that he was ashamed. I dared not speak
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
to him; but since then, whenever my eyes
have met his, I have seen that look of understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear you will not see it to-night,&#8221; said the
Captain. &#8220;They are drinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but he is not. He is guarding the hut.
Come, M&#8217;sieu, it may be that we can see him
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard rose, and with the priest peered
through the cracks at the rear of the hut.
After a moment they saw him, standing in the
shadow of a tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure it is he, Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, M&#8217;sieu, I should know him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard rested his hand on a strip of rotting
bark in the wall. The priest saw the movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said cautiously, &#8220;it would be very
simple. But you will be cautious, M&#8217;sieu. Of
course, I do not know&ndash;&ndash;I cannot tell surely&ndash;&ndash;and
yet it must be that Teganouan still has a
warm heart. It cannot be that he has forgotten
the many months of my kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>While they stood there, hesitating between a
dozen hasty plans, a light step sounded, and in
an instant their eyes were at the opening. A
second Indian had joined the guard, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
talking with him in a low voice. Father Claude
gripped the Captain&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;the wampum collar,&ndash;&ndash;it is
the Long Arrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard laid his finger on his lips. The two
Indians were not a dozen yards away. The
chief swayed unsteadily as he talked, and once
his voice rose. He carried a bottle, and paused
now and then to drink from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan is holding back,&#8221; whispered
Menard. &#8220;See, the Long Arrow has taken his
arm&ndash;&ndash;they are coming&ndash;&ndash;is the door fast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot make it fast, M&#8217;sieu. It opens
outward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard sprang across to the door and ran
his hands over it, but found no projection that
could be used to hold it closed. He stood for
a moment, puzzling; then his face hardened,
and he fell back to where the priest and the
maid stood side by side.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will get in, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It is better.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not speak again. The moccasined
feet made no noise on the cleared ground, and
it seemed a long time before they could hear
the log fall from the door. There were voices
outside. At last the door swung open, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
Long Arrow, bottle in hand, came clumsily into
the hut and stood unsteadily in the square of
moonlight. He looked about as if he could not
see them. Teganouan had come in behind
him; and the door swung to, creaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Chief is the brother of the
Long Arrow,&#8221; said the chief, speaking slowly
and with an effort to make his words distinct.
&#8220;He loves the Onondagas. Deep in his mind
are the thoughts of the young white brave who
lived in our villages and hunted with our braves
and called the mighty Big Throat his father.
He never forgets what the Onondagas have
done for him. He has a grateful heart.&#8221; The
effort of speaking was confusing to the chief.
He paused, as if to collect his ideas, and looked
stupidly at the three silent figures before him.
&#8220; ... grateful heart,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;The Long
Arrow has a grateful heart, too. He remembers
the kind words of the white men who come to
his village and tell him of the love of the Great
Mountain. He never forgets that the Big Buffalo
is his brother&ndash;&ndash;he never forgets. When
the Big Buffalo took his son from the hunting
party of the Onondagas he did not forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard did not listen further. He was looking
about the hut with quick, shifting eyes, now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
at the chief in the moonlight, now at Teganouan,
who stood at one side in the shadow,
now at the door. Could Teganouan be trusted
to help them? He glanced sharply at the warrior,
who was looking at his chief with an alert,
cunning expression. His musket lay carelessly
in the hollow of his arm, his knife and hatchet
hung at his waist. The chief had only his
knife; in his hand was the bottle, which he
held loosely, now and then spilling a few drops
of the liquor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Long Arrow nev&#8217;r f&#8217;rgets,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;the chief&#8217;s
tongue was getting the better of him. &#8220;His
house is lonely, where the fire burns alone and
the young warr&#8217;r who once laid &#8217;s blanket,&ndash;&ndash;laid
&#8217;s blanket by the fire, no long&#8217;r &#8217;s there to
warm the heart of the Long Arrow. But now
his loneliness is gone. Now when he comes
from the hunt to &#8217;s house he&#8217;ll find a new fire,
a bright fire, and a new squaw to warm &#8217;s heart&ndash;&ndash;warm
&#8217;s heart.&#8221; He swayed a little as he
spoke, and Teganouan took a short step forward;
but the chief drew himself up and came
slowly across the patch of moonlight. His eyes
were unnaturally bright, and they rolled uncertainly
from one to another of the little group
before him. His coarse black hair was matted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
and tangled, and the eagle feathers that at the
council had stood erect from his head now
drooped, straggling, to one side.</p>
<p>The maid had understood. The two men
drew close to her on each side, and her hand
rested, trembling, on Menard&#8217;s arm. All three
were thinking fast. One scream, the sound of
a struggle or even of loud voices, would bring
upon them the whole drunken band. As the
chief approached, the maid could feel the muscles
harden on the Captain&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Arrow&#8217;s lonely&ndash;&ndash;his fire&#8217;s not bright
when he comes from hunt&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Here and there
in his talk a few words were distinguishable as
he stood lurching before them. He reached
out in a maudlin effort to touch the maid&#8217;s
white face. She drew in her breath quickly
and stepped back; then Menard had sprung
forward, and she covered her eyes with her
hands.</p>
<p>There was a light scuffle, but no other sound.
A strong smell of brandy filled the hut. Slowly
she lifted her head, and let her hands drop to
her sides. The Long Arrow lay sprawling at
her feet, his head gashed and bleeding, and
covered with broken glass and dripping liquor.
The priest had kneeled beside him, and over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
his bowed head she saw Teganouan, startled,
defiant, his musket halfway to his shoulder,
his eyes fixed on the door. Her eyes followed
his gaze. There stood the Captain, his back
to the door, the broken neck of the bottle firmly
gripped in his hand.</p>
<p>She stepped forward, too struck with horror
to remain silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, M&#8217;sieu!&#8221; she said brokenly, stretching
out her hands.</p>
<p>He motioned to her to be quiet, and she
sank down on the bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The priest looked up questioningly. There
was a long moment of silence, and the shouts
and calls of the half-drunken revellers without
sounded strangely loud. Then, as the priest
gazed at the set, hard face of the Captain, and
at the motionless Indian, he understood of a
sudden all the wild plan that was forming in
the Captain&#8217;s mind. He rose slowly to his
feet, and stood facing Teganouan, with the
light streaming down upon his gentle face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun has gone to sleep many times,
Teganouan, since you left the great white
house of the church at St. Francis. You
have heard the counsel of evil men, who think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
only of the knife and the hatchet and the
musket, who have no dream but to slay their
brothers.&#8221; He was speaking slowly and in a
kindly voice, as a father might speak to a son
who has wandered from the right. &#8220;Have
you forgotten the talk of the holy Fathers,
when they told you the words of the Book of the
Great Spirit, who is to all your Manitous and
Okis as the sun is to the stars. Have you forgotten
the many moons that passed while you
lived in the great white house,&ndash;&ndash;when you
gave your promise, the promise of an Onondaga,
that you would be a friend to the white
man, that you would believe the words of the
Great Spirit and live a peaceful life? Have you
forgotten, Teganouan, the evil days when your
enemy, the fire-water, took possession of your
heart and led you away from the white house
into the lodges of them that do wrong,&ndash;&ndash;how
when the good spirit returned to you and you
came back to the arms of the Faith, you were
received as a son and a brother? The holy
Fathers did not say, &#8216;This warrior has done
that which he should not do. Let him be
punished. We have no place for the wrongdoer.&#8217;
No; they did not say this. They said,
&#8216;The lost is found. He that wandered from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
the fold has returned.&#8217; And they welcomed
the lost one, and bade him repent and lead a
right life. Have you forgotten, Teganouan?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian had slowly lowered his musket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan has not forgotten,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;He has a grateful heart toward the holy
Fathers of the great white house. When he
was sick, they brought him their good doctor
and told him to live. He believed that the
white men were his brothers, that they would
do to him as the Fathers had promised. But
when Teganouan came to the white men, and
asked to be made like they were, he left behind
in his village a brother and a sister and a father
who said that he was a traitor, who said that
he was false to the trust of his blood and his
nation, that he was not of their blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did he believe them? Did he not
know, better than they could, that the faith of
the white man is also the faith of the redman;
that the love of the white man includes all who
breathe and speak and hunt and trade and
move upon the earth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan has not forgotten. He heard
the words of the Fathers, and he believed that
they were true; but when the white Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
took from the Onondagas five score of their
bravest warriors and called them slaves, when
he took the brother of Teganouan, borne by
the same mother and fed by the same hand, to
be a slave of the mighty Chief-Across-the-Water,
could he remember what the holy
Fathers had said,&ndash;&ndash;that all men were
brothers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan has heard what the White
Chief, the Big Buffalo, has said, that the evil
man who was treacherous to the Onondagas
shall be punished?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan understands. But the evil man
is far from the vengeance of the white man.
The White Chief is here in our lodges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard left the door and came to the
priest&#8217;s side. The jagged piece of glass, his
only weapon, he threw to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan,&#8221; he said slowly and firmly, looking
into the Indian&#8217;s eyes, &#8220;you heard the
great council at the Long House of the Five
Nations. You heard the decision of the chiefs
and warriors, that they whom Onontio had
sent to bring a message of peace should be
set free. You have broken the pledge made
by your council. You have attacked us and
made us prisoners, and brought us here where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
we may be tortured and killed and none may
know. But when the Great Mountain finds
that the Big Buffalo has not come back, when
he sends his white soldier to the villages of the
Onondagas and asks what they have done to
him who brought his voice, what will you say?
When the chiefs say, &#8216;We set him free,&#8217; and look
about to find the warrior who has dared to
disobey the Long House, what will you say?
When the young boys and the drunkards with
loose tongues have told the story of the death
of the Long Arrow, what will you say? Then
you will be glad to flee to the white house of
the holy Fathers, knowing that they will protect
you and save you when the braves of your
own blood shall pursue you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teganouan&#8217;s eyelids had drooped, and now he
was looking at the ground, where the chief lay.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will come with me, Teganouan. You
will fly with us over the Long Lake, and
through the forests and down the mighty rivers
and over the inland sea, and there you shall
be safe; and you shall see with your own eyes
the punishment that the Great Mountain will
give to the evil man who has been false to the
Onondagas.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hand, and silently waited.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
The priest&#8217;s head was raised, and his lips moved
slowly in prayer. The maid sat rigid, her
hands tightly gripping the edge of the bench.
Though he knew that every moment brought
nearer the chance of discovery, that the lives
of them all hung on a thread as slender as a
hair, the Captain stood without the twitching
of a muscle, without a sign of fear or haste in
his grave, worn face.</p>
<p>The Indian&#8217;s eyes wavered. He looked at the
fallen chief, at the priest, at Menard; then he
took the offered hand. No further word was
needed. Menard did not know the thought
that lay behind the cunning face; it was
enough that the Indian had given his word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, we must hide him,&#8221; said the Captain,
looking swiftly about the hut. &#8220;We must disturb
you, Mademoiselle&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment the three men had lifted the
body of the Long Arrow and laid it away under
the low bench. Teganouan scraped a few
handfuls of earth from a corner and spread it
over the spot where the chief had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is it to the lake, Teganouan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a few rods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the forest is thick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We must cross the lake. Is there a canoe
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian shook his head. Menard stood
thinking for an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are thinking of me, M&#8217;sieu, I think I
can swim with you,&#8221; said the maid, timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no other way, Mademoiselle. I
am sorry. But we will make it as easy as we
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped to the rear wall, and with a blow
of his fist would have broken an opening
through the rotted bank, but the Indian caught
his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not necessary. See.&#8221; He set rapidly
to work, and in a few silent moments he had
unlaced the thread-like root that held the sheet
of bark in place, and lowered it to the ground.
He raised himself by the cross-pole that marked
the top of the wall, and slipped through the
opening. A few quick glances through the
trees, and he turned and beckoned. Menard followed,
with the knife of the Long Arrow between
his teeth; and with Father Claude&#8217;s help
the maid got through to where he could catch
her and lower her to the ground.</p>
<p>The Indian made a cautious gesture and
crept slowly through the yielding bushes. One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
by one they followed, the Captain lingering
until the maid was close to him and he could
whisper to her to keep her courage. They
paused at the bank of the lake. The water
lay sparkling in the moonlight. Menard looked
grimly out; this light added to the danger.
He found a short log close at hand and carried
it to the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Mademoiselle,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;and
Father Claude. This will support you. Teganouan
and I will swim. Keep low in the
water, and do not splash or speak. The slightest
noise will travel far across the lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly they waded out, dropping into the
water before it was waist deep. Teganouan&#8217;s
powder-horn and musket lay on the log, and
the maid herself steadied it so that they should
not be lost.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>NORTHWARD.</h3>
</div>
<p>Weak and chilled from the long swim
through the cold water they dragged
themselves across the narrow beach to the bushes
that hung over the bank. Menard and Father
Claude supported the maid, who was trembling
and clinging to them. At the bank she sank
to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hard, Mademoiselle, but we must not
stop. It is better to be weary than to rest in
this condition. It would mean sickness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I know. In a moment I
can go on.&#8221; She looked up and tried to smile.
&#8220;It is so cold, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard turned to Teganouan.</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is it to the villages of the Cayugas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not far. Half a sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a trail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trail is far. It passes the end of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
Long Lake.&#8221; He raised his head and looked
at the stars, then pointed to the southwest.
&#8220;The nearest village lies there. If we go
through the forest toward the setting sun, we
shall meet the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it will be wise to go to the Cayugas,
M&#8217;sieu?&#8221; asked Father Claude.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. The chiefs must have returned
before this time, or at least by the morrow.&#8221;
He dropped into the Iroquois tongue. &#8220;Is not
this so, Teganouan? Would the chiefs of
the Cayugas linger among the Onondagas
after the close of the council?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cayuga warriors await the word of the
Long House. They know that their chiefs
would hasten to bring it back to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It must be so, Father. And we can
trust them to aid us. Perhaps they will give
us a canoe. Teganouan must tell them he is our
guide, sent by the Big Throat and the chiefs of
the Onondagas to take us safely to Frontenac.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid was struggling to keep awake, but
her lids were heavy. Menard came to her and
stood, hesitating. She knew that he was
there; she could hear the rustle of his wet
clothes, and his heavy breathing, but she did
not look up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, lightly touching her shoulder,
&#8220;we cannot wait here. We must go.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not reply, and he hesitated again.
Then he stooped and lifted her in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will go ahead, Teganouan,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and you, too, if you will, Father Claude.
Choose an easy trail if you can, and be careful
that no twig flies back.&#8221;</p>
<p>They set out slowly through the forest. The
priest and the Indian laboriously broke a way,
and Menard followed, holding the maid tenderly,
and now and then, in some lighter spot
where a beam of moonlight fell through the
foliage, looking down at her gentle, weary face.
She was sleeping; and he prayed that no sad
dreams might come to steal her rest. His arms
ached and his knees gave under him, but he
had hardly a thought for himself. At last, after
a long, silent march, the priest stopped, and said,
supporting himself with one thin hand against a
tree:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are weary, M&#8217;sieu. You must let me
take Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Father, no. I have been thinking. I
am afraid it is not right that she should sleep
now. Even though she fail in the effort, exercise
of her muscles is all that will prevent sickness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
And yet I cannot,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he looked again
at her face as it rested against his shoulder,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
cannot awaken her now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Father saw the sorrow in the Captain&#8217;s
eyes, and understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take her, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carefully Menard placed her in Father
Claude&#8217;s arms and turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan,&#8221; he said, trying to recover his
self-possession, &#8220;should we not be near the
trail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, more than half the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we reach it more quickly by heading a
little to the north?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We would reach the trail, yes; but the way
would be longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind; once on the trail it will be
easier than in this forest. Turn to the north,
Teganouan.&#8221;</p>
<p>He could hear the maid&#8217;s voice, protesting
sleepily, and Father Claude talking quietly to
her. He looked around. The priest said in a
low tone:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, M&#8217;sieu, it is hard to awaken her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must frighten her, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught her shoulders and shook her
roughly. Slowly her eyes opened, and then the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
two men dragged her forward. At first she
thought herself back among the Onondagas,
and she begged them not to take her away,
hanging back and forcing them almost to carry
her. It cut Menard to the heart, but he pushed
steadily forward. Later she yielded, and with a
dazed expression obeyed. Once or twice she
stumbled, and would have fallen but for the
strong hands that held her. Father Claude
rested his hand on her forehead as they walked,
and Menard gave him an anxious, questioning
glance. The priest shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is no fever. I trust
that it is nothing worse than exhaustion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard went on with relief in his eyes.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour after reaching the
trail, they came upon the outlying huts of the
village. Over the hills to the east the dawn
was breaking, and all the sleeping birds and
beasts and creeping things of the forest were
stirring into life and movement. Teganouan
went ahead of the party and soon roused a member
of the Cayuga branch of his clan, the family
of the Bear. Through the yawning services of
this warrior they were guided to an unused hut.
Teganouan searched farther, and returned with
a heap of blankets for the maid, who had dropped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
to the ground before the hut. Menard carried
her within and made her as comfortable as possible,
then withdrew and closed the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the chiefs returned from the council
at the village of the Onondagas?&#8221; he asked of
the warrior, who stood at one side watching
them with curiosity in his gaze.</p>
<p>The Cayuga bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will my brother carry a message from the
White Chief, the Big Buffalo, to his chiefs?
Will he tell them, as soon as the sun has risen,
that the Big Buffalo has come to talk with
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>The warrior bowed and walked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are safe now, I think, Father. We
must get what little sleep we can between now
and sunrise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should not one of us watch, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not fit for it. We have hard work
before us, and many a chance yet to run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan will watch,&#8221; said the Indian.</p>
<p>Menard&#8217;s face showed surprise, but Father
Claude whispered, &#8220;He has learned at the mission
to understand our language.&#8221;</p>
<p>They lay on the ground before the hut, in
their wet clothes, and in a moment were asleep.
Teganouan built a fire close at hand, and sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
by it without a motion, excepting the alert shifting
glances of his bead-like eyes, until, when the
colours in the east had faded into blue and the
sun was well above the trees, he saw the chiefs
of the village coming slowly toward him between
the huts, a crowd of young men following behind
them, and a snarling pack of dogs running before.
He aroused Menard and Father Claude.</p>
<p>The chiefs sat in a circle about the fire, the
two white men among them. The other Indians
sat and stood in a wider circle, just within earshot,
and waited inquisitively for the White
Chief to state his errand.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brothers, the white men, have asked to
speak with the chiefs of the Cayugas,&#8221; said the
spokesman, a wrinkled old warrior, whom Menard
recognized as one of the speakers at the
Long House.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo is on his way to the stone
house of Onontio. He is far from the trail.
His muskets and his knives and hatchets were
taken from him by the Onondagas and were not
returned to him. He asks that the chiefs of
the Cayugas permit him to use one of their
many canoes, that he may hasten to carry to
Onontio the word of the Long House.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Chief comes to the Cayugas, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
live two sleeps away from their brothers, the
Onondagas, to ask for aid. Have the Onondagas
then refused him? Why is my brother
so far from the trail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The chiefs of the Cayugas sat in the Long
House; they heard the words of the great council,
that the Big Buffalo and the holy Father
and the white maiden should be set free. They
know that what is decided in the council is the
law of the nation, that no warrior shall break
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little circle was silent with attention, but
none of the chiefs replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was still in the dark of the night when
the Big Throat came to the lodge of the Big
Buffalo, and gave him the pledge of the council
that he should be free with the next sun. The
Big Buffalo once learned to believe the pledge
of the Iroquois. When the mighty Big Throat
said that he was free, he believed. He did not
set a guard to sit with wakeful eyes through the
night in fear that the pledge was not true. No,
the Big Buffalo is a warrior and a chief; he is
not a woman. He trusted his red brothers, and
rested his head to sleep. Then in the dark
came a chief, a dog of a traitor, and took away
his white brother and his white sister while their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
eyes were still heavy with sleep, and carried
them far over the hills to the lake of the Cayugas.
Here they hid like serpents in the long
grass, and thought that they would kill them.
But the Big Buffalo is a warrior. Without a
knife or a musket or a hatchet he killed the
Long Arrow and came across the Long Lake.
He knew that the Cayugas were his brothers,
that they would not break the pledge of the
Long House.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grave faces of the Indians showed no
surprise, save for a slight movement of the
eyes on the part of one or two of the younger
men, when the Long Arrow was mentioned.
Most of them had lighted their pipes before
sitting down, and now they puffed in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Chief speaks strangely,&#8221; the
spokesman said at last. &#8220;He tells the Cayugas
that their brothers, the Onondagas, have
broken the pledge of the council.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He asks for aid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Menard, &#8220;he does not ask for aid.
He asks that the Iroquois nation restore to him
what the dogs of the Long Arrow have taken
away. He has spoken to the Long House in
the voice of the Great Mountain. He has the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
right of a free man, of a chief honoured by the
council, to go freely and in peace. What if
those who do not respect the law of the council
shall rob him of his rights? Must he go on his
knees to the chiefs? Must he ask that he be
allowed to live? Must he go far back on his
trail to seek aid of the Onondagas, because the
Cayugas will not hold to the law?&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the great lessons learned during Menard&#8217;s
work under Governor Frontenac had been
that the man who once permits himself to be
lowered in the eyes of the Indians has forever
lost his prestige. Now he sat before the chiefs
of a great village, weak from the strain of the
long days and nights of distress and wakefulness
and hunger, his clothing still wet and bedraggled,
with no weapon but a knife, no canoe,
not to speak of presents,&ndash;&ndash;with none of the
equipment which to the Indian mind suggested
authority,&ndash;&ndash;and yet made his demands in the
stern voice of a conqueror. He knew that these
Indians cared not at all whether the word of
the council to him had been broken or kept,
unless he could so impress them with his
authority that they would fear punishment for
the offence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo is a mighty warrior,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
the spokesman. &#8220;His hard hands are greater
than the muskets and hatchets of the Cayugas.
He fights with the strength of the winter wind;
no man can stand where his hand falls. He
speaks wisely to the Cayugas. They are sorry
that their brothers, the Onondagas, have so
soon forgotten the word of the great council,
Let the Big Buffalo rest his arms. The warriors
of the Cayugas shall be proud to offer
him food.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all rose, and after a few grunted words
of friendship, filed away to go over the matter
in private council. Menard saw that they were
puzzled; perhaps they did not believe that he
had killed the Long Arrow. He turned to
Teganouan, who had been sitting a few yards
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan, will you go among the braves
of the village and tell them that the Big
Buffalo is a strong fighter, that he killed the
Long Arrow with his hands? It may be that
they have not believed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the kind of strategy Teganouan
understood. He walked slowly away, puffing
at his pipe, to mingle among the people of the
village and boast in bold metaphors the prowess
of his White Chief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They will give us a canoe,&#8221; said Father
Claude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they must. Now, let us sleep again.&#8221;</p>
<p>They dropped to the ground, and Menard
looked warningly at the circle of young boys
who came as close as they dared to see this
strange white man, and to hear him talk in the
unpronounceable language. Father Claude&#8217;s
eyes were first to close. The Captain was
about to join him in slumber when a low voice
came from the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started up and saw the maid holding
the door ajar and leaning against it, her pale
face, framed in a tangle of soft hair, showing
traces of the wearing troubles of the days just
passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Mademoiselle, you must not waken.
You must sleep long, and rest, and grow bright
and young again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled, and looked at him timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been dreaming, M&#8217;sieu,&#8221; she said, and
her eyes dropped, &#8220;such an unpleasant dream.
It was after we had crossed the lake&ndash;&ndash;We
did cross it, M&#8217;sieu, did we not? That, too, was
not a dream? No&ndash;&ndash;see, my hair is wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that was not a dream.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We were on the land, and I was so tired,
and you talked to me&ndash;&ndash;something good&ndash;&ndash;I
cannot remember what it was, but I know that
you were good. And I thought that I&ndash;&ndash;that
I said words that hurt you, unkind words. And
when I wished and tried to speak as I felt, only
the other words would come. That was a
dream, M&#8217;sieu, was it not? It has been troubling
me. You have been so kind, and I could
not sleep thinking that&ndash;&ndash;that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that was a dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with relief, but as she
looked she seemed to become more fully awake
to what they were saying. Her eyes lowered
again, and the red came over her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad,&#8221; she said, so low that he hardly
heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now you will rest, Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled softly, and drew back within the
hut, closing the heavy door. And Menard
turned away, unmindful of the wide-eyed boys
who were staring from a safe distance at him
and at the door where the strange woman had
appeared. He sat with his back against the
logs of the hut, and looked at the ants that
hurried about over the trampled ground.</p>
<p>The sun was high when he was aroused by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
Teganouan, who had spent the greater part
of the morning among the people of the village.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any word, Teganouan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The warriors have learned of the
strength of the Big Buffalo, and his name
frightens them. They bow to the great chief
who has killed the Long Arrow without a
hatchet. They say that the Onondagas should
be punished for their treachery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan has been talking long with a
runner of the Seneca nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, he brings word of the fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The Senecas have suffered under the
iron hand of the Great Mountain. A great
army takes up the hatchet when he goes on
the war-path, more than all the Senecas and
Cayugas and Onondagas together when every
brave who can hold in his hand a bow or a
musket has come to fight with his brothers.
There were white warriors so many that the
runner could not have counted them with all
the sticks in the Long House. There were
men of the woods in the skins and beads of
the redmen; there were Hurons and Ottawas
and Nipissings, and even the cowardly Illinois
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
and the Kaskaskias and the Miamis from
the land where the Great River flows past the
Rock Demons. The Senecas fought with the
strength of the she-bear, but their warriors were
killed, their corn was trampled and cut, their
lodges were burned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the Great Mountain pursue them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has gone back to his stone house
across the great lake, leaving the land black
and smoking. The Senecas have come to
the western villages of the Cayugas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are none in this village?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But the chiefs have sent blankets to
their brothers, and as much corn as a hundred
braves could carry over the trail. They have
taken from their own houses to give to the
Senecas.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few moments later two young men came
with baskets of sagamity and smoked meat.
Menard received it, and rising, knocked gently
at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, M&#8217;sieu,&ndash;&ndash;I am not sleeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated, and she came to the door and
opened it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you have food, M&#8217;sieu! I am glad. I
have been so hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Father,&#8221; said the Captain, and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
entered and sat on the long bench, eating the
smoky, greasy meat as eagerly as if it had been
cooked for the Governor&#8217;s table. Their spirits
rose as the baskets emptied, and they found
that they could laugh and joke about their
ravenous hunger.</p>
<p>The chiefs returned shortly after, and came
stooping into the hut in the free Indian fashion.
The old chief spoke:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo has honoured the lodges of
the Cayugas; he has made the village proud to
offer him their corn and meat. It would make
their hearts glad if he would linger about their
fires, with the holy Father and the squaw, that
they might tell their brothers of the great warrior
who dwelt in their village. But the White
Chief bears the word of the Long House.
He goes to the stone house to tell his white
brothers, who fight with the thunder, that the
Cayugas and the Onondagas are friends of the
white men, that they have given a pledge
which binds them as close as could the stoutest
ropes of deerskin. And so with sad hearts
they come to say farewell to the Big Buffalo,
and to wish that no dog may howl while he
sleeps, that no wind may blow against his
canoe, that no rains may fall until he rests
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
with his brothers at the great stone house
beyond the lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo thanks the mighty chiefs
of the Cayugas,&#8221; replied Menard. &#8220;He is glad
that they are his friends. And when his mouth
is close to the ear of the Great Mountain, he
will tell him that his Cayuga sons are loyal to
their Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief had lighted a long pipe. After
two deliberate puffs, the first upward toward
the roof of the hut, the second toward the
ground, he handed it to Menard, who followed
his example, and passed it to the chief next in
importance. As it went slowly from hand to
hand about the circle, the Captain turned to
the maid, who sat at his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they mean it, M&#8217;sieu?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>For an instant a twinkle came into his eye;
she saw it, and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>Before she could check the smile, a bronze
hand reached across to her with the pipe. She
started back and looked down at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must smoke it,&#8221; Menard whispered.
&#8220;It is a great honour. They have admitted
you to their council.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, M&#8217;sieu&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she took the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
pipe and held it awkwardly; then, with an
effort, raised it to her mouth. It made her
cough, and she gave it quickly to the Captain.</p>
<p>The Indians rose gravely and filed out of
the hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Mademoiselle, we are to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The smoke had brought tears to her eyes, and
she was hesitating, laughing in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, M&#8217;sieu, will&ndash;&ndash;will it make me sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled, with a touch of the old light
humour.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. We must go, or they will
wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found the chiefs waiting before the hut,
Father Claude and Teganouan among them.
As soon as they had appeared, the whole party
set out through the village and over a trail
through the woods to the eastward. The ill-kept
dogs played about them, and plunged,
barking, through the brush on either side.
Behind, at a little distance, came the children
and hangers-on of the village, jostling one
another to keep at the head where they could
see the white strangers.</p>
<p>When they reached the bank of the lake, they
found two canoes drawn up on the narrow strip
of gravel, and a half-dozen well-armed braves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
waiting close at hand. The chief paused and
pointed toward the canoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cayugas are proud that the White
Chief will sail in their canoes to the land of the
white men. The bravest warriors of a mighty
village will go with them to see that no Onondaga
arrow flies into their camp by night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He signalled to a brave, who brought forward
a musket and laid it, with powder-horn
and bullet-pouch, at the Captain&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;This musket is to tell the Big Buffalo that
no wild beast shall disturb his feast, and that
meat in plenty shall hang from the smoking-pole
in his lodge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The canoes were carried into the water and
they embarked,&ndash;&ndash;Menard, the maid, and two
braves in one, Father Claude and four braves
in the other. They swung out into the lake,
the wiry arms and shoulders of the canoemen
knotting with each stroke of the paddles; and
the crowd of Indians stood on the shore gazing
after until they had passed from view beyond
a wooded point.</p>
<p>A few hours should take them to the head
of the lake. They had reached perhaps half
the distance, when Menard saw that two of his
canoemen had exchanged glances and were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
looking toward the shore. He glanced along
the fringe of trees and bushes, a few hundred
yards distant, until his eyes rested on three
empty canoes. He called to Father Claude&#8217;s
canoe, and both, at his order, headed for the
shore. As they drew near, half a score of
Indians came from the brush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the maid, &#8220;there are some of the
men who brought us to the lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Menard, &#8220;it is the Long
Arrow&#8217;s band.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaped out of the canoe before it touched
the beach, and walked sternly up to the
group of warriors. He knew why they were
there. It was what he had expected. When
they had discovered the death of the Long
Arrow there had been rage and consternation.
Disputes had followed, the band had divided,
and a part had crossed the lake to hunt the
trail of the Big Buffalo. He folded his arms
and gave them a long, contemptuous look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do the Onondagas seek the trail of the
Big Buffalo? Do they think to overtake him?
Do they think that all their hands together are
strong enough to hold him? Did they think
that they could lie to the White Chief, could
play the traitor, and go unpunished?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span></p>
<p>Only one or two of the Onondagas had their
muskets in their hands. They all showed
fright, and one was edging toward the wood.
The Cayugas in the canoes, at a word from
Father Claude, had raised their muskets.
Menard saw the movement from the corner
of his eye, and for the moment doubted the
wisdom of the action. It was a question whether
the Cayugas could actually be brought to fire
on their Onondaga brothers. Still, this band
had defied the law of the council, and might, in
the eyes of the Indians, bring down another
war upon the nation by their act. While he
spoke, the Captain had been deciding on a
course. He now walked boldly up to the man
who was nearest the bushes, and snatched
away his musket. There was a stir and
a murmur, but without heeding, he took
also the only other musket in the party,
and stepped between the Indians and the
forest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand where you are, or I will kill you.
One man&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he pointed to a youth&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;will
go into the forest and bring your muskets to
the canoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>They hesitated, but Menard held his piece
ready to fire, and the Cayugas did the same.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
At last the youth went sullenly into the bushes
and brought out an armful of muskets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Count them, Father,&#8221; Menard called in
French.</p>
<p>The priest did so, and then ran his eye over
the party on the beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two missing, M&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard turned to the youth, who, though
he had not understood the words, caught their
spirit and hurried back for the missing weapons.
Then the Captain walked coolly past
them, and took his place in the canoe. For a
long time, as they paddled up the lake, they
could see the Onondagas moving about the
beach, and could hear their angry voices.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>THE ONLY WAY.</h3>
</div>
<p>When at last the canoe slipped from the
confines of river and hills and forest out
upon the great Lake Ontario, where the green
water stretched flat, east and north and west to
the horizon, the Cayuga warriors said farewell
and turned again to their own lands. It was at
noon of a bright day. The water lay close to
the white beach, with hardly a ripple to mar the
long black scallops of weed and drift which the
last storm had left on the sand. The sky was
fair and the air sweet.</p>
<p>In the one canoe which the Cayugas had left
to them, the little party headed to the east, now
skimming close to the silent beach, now cutting
a straight path across some bay from point
to point, out over the depths where lay the
sturgeon and the pickerel and trout and whitefish.
The gulls swooped at them; then, frightened,
soared away in wide, rushing circles,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
dropping here and there for an overbold minnow.
The afternoon went by with hardly the passing
of a word. Each of them, the Captain, the
maid, the priest, looked over the burnished water,
now a fair green or blue sheet, now a space
of striped yellow and green and purple, newly
marked by every phase of sun and cloud; and
to each it meant that the journey was done.
Here was solitude, with none of the stir of the
forest to bring companionship; but as they
looked out to the cloud-puffs that dipped behind
the water at the world&#8217;s end, they knew
that far yonder were other men whose skins
were white, for all of beard and tan, whose
tongue was the tongue of Montreal, of Quebec,
of Paris,&ndash;&ndash;and neither tree nor rock nor mountain
lay between. The water that bore them
onward was the water that washed the beach
at Frontenac. Days might pass and find them
still on the road; but they would be glorious
days, with the sun overhead and the breeze
at their backs, and at evening the wonder of the
western sky to make the water golden with
promise. As they swung their paddles, the
maid with them, their eyes were full of dreams,&ndash;&ndash;all
save Teganouan. His eyes were keen
and cunning, and when they looked to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
north it was not with thoughts of home. It may
be that he was dreaming of the deed which
might yet win back his lost name as an Onondaga
warrior.</p>
<p>The sun hung over the lake when at last
the canoe touched the beach. They ate their
simple meal almost in silence, and then sat near
the fire watching the afterglow that did not
fade from the west until the night was dark
and the moon high over the dim line that
marked the eastern end of the lake. The
sense of relief that had come to them with the
first sight of the lake was fading now. They
were thinking of Frontenac, and of what might
await them there,&ndash;&ndash;the priest soberly, the
maid bravely, the Captain grimly. Later,
when the maid had said good-night, and Father
Claude had wandered down the beach to the
water&#8217;s edge, Menard dragged a new log to the
fire and threw it on, sending up the flame and
sparks high above the willows of the bank. He
stretched out and looked into the flames.</p>
<p>Teganouan, who had been lying on the sand,
heard a rustle far off in the forest and raised
his head. He heard it again, and rose, standing
motionless; then he took his musket and
came toward the fire. The Captain lay at full
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
length, his chin on his hands. He was awake,
for his eyes were open, but he did not look up.
The Indian hesitated, and stood a few yards
away looking at the silent figure, as if uncertain
whether to speak. Finally he stepped
back and disappeared among the willows.</p>
<p>Half an hour went by. Father Claude came
up the beach, walking slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is growing late, M&#8217;sieu, for travellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard glanced up, but did not reply. The
priest was looking about the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Teganouan, M&#8217;sieu? Did you
give him permission to go away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he is here,&ndash;&ndash;he was here.&#8221; Menard
rose. &#8220;You are right, he has gone. Has he
taken his musket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. I do not see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He left it leaning against the log. No; it
is not there. Wait,&ndash;&ndash;do you hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood listening; and both caught the
faint sound of a body moving between the
bushes that grew on the higher ground, close
to the line of willows. Menard took up his
musket and held it ready, for they had not left
the country of the Iroquois.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he comes,&#8221; whispered Father Claude.
&#8220;Yes, it is Teganouan.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span></p>
<p>The Indian was running toward them. He
dropped his musket, and began rapidly to throw
great handfuls of sand upon the fire. The two
white men sprang to aid him, without asking
an explanation. In a moment the beach was
lighted only by the moon. Then Menard
said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Teganouan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan heard a step in the forest. He
went nearer, and there were more. They are
on the war-path, for they come cautiously and
slowly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, will you keep by the maid? We
must not disturb her now. You had better heap
up the sand about the canoe so that no stray
ball can reach her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest hurried down the beach, and
Menard and the Indian slipped into the willows,
Menard toward the east, Teganouan toward the
west, where they could watch the forest and
the beach on all sides. The sound of an approaching
party was now more distinct. There
would be a long silence, then the crackle of a
twig or the rustle of dead leaves; and Menard
knew that the sound was made by moccasined
feet. He was surprised that the invaders took
so little caution; either they were confident of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
finding the camp asleep, or they were in such
force as to have no fear. While he lay behind
a scrub willow conjecturing, Father Claude
came creeping up behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will watch with you, M&#8217;sieu. It will make
our line longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I have heaped the sand high around
the canoe, even on the side toward the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. You had better move off a little
nearer the lake, and keep a sharp eye out. It
may be that they are coming by water as well,
though I doubt it. The lake is very light. I
will take the centre. You have no musket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but my eyes are good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you need me, I shall be close to the
bushes, a dozen yards farther inland.&#8221;</p>
<p>They separated, and Menard took up his
new position. Apparently the movement had
stopped. For a long time no sound came, and
then, as Menard was on the point of moving
forward, a branch cracked sharply not twenty
rods away. He called in French:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence, then a rush
of feet in his direction. He could hear a number
of men bounding through the bushes. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
cocked his gun and levelled it, shouting this
time in Iroquois:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand, or I will fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that voice! Drop your musket!&#8221;
came in a merry French voice, and in another
moment a sturdy figure, half in uniform and
half in buckskin, bearded beyond recognition,
had come crashing down the slope, throwing
his arms around the Captain&#8217;s neck so wildly
that the two went down and rolled on the sand.
Before Menard could struggle to his feet, three
soldiers had followed, and stood laughing, forgetting
all discipline, and one was saying over
and over to the other:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Captain Menard! Don&#8217;t you know
him? It is Captain Menard!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know me, Menard, I can see that.
I wish I could take the beard off, but I can&#8217;t.
What have you done with my men?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Menard knew; it was Du Peron.</p>
<p>&#8220;I left them at La Gallette,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen them&ndash;&ndash;oh, killed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down the beach and tell me about it.
What condition are you in? Have you anybody
with you?&#8221; Before Menard could answer,
he said to one of the soldiers:&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go back and tell the sergeant to bring up
the canoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked down the beach, and the other
soldiers set about building a new fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;d better begin on you,&#8221; Menard
said. &#8220;What are you doing here? And what
in the devil do you mean by coming up through
the woods like a Mohawk on the war-path?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My story isn&#8217;t a long one. I&#8217;m cleaning
up our base of supplies at La Famine. We&#8217;ve
got a small guard there. The main part of the
rear-guard is back at Frontenac.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the column?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to Niagara, Denonville and all, to
build a fort. They&#8217;ll give it to De Troyes, I
imagine. It&#8217;s a sort of triumphal procession
through the enemy&#8217;s country, after rooting up
the Seneca villages and fields and stockades
until you can&#8217;t find an able-bodied redskin this
side of the Cayugas. Oh, I didn&#8217;t answer your
other question. What do you think of these?&#8221;
He held out a foot, shod in a moccasin. &#8220;You&#8217;d
never know the King&#8217;s troops now, Menard.
We&#8217;re wearing anything we can pick up. I&#8217;ve
got a dozen canoes a quarter of a league down
the lake. I saw your fire, and thought it best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
to reconnoitre before bringing the canoes past.&#8221;
He read the question in Menard&#8217;s glance. &#8220;We
are not taking out much time for sleep, I can
tell you. It&#8217;s all day and all night until we get
La Famine cleared up. There is only a handful
of men there, and we&#8217;re expecting every day
that the Cayugas and Onondagas will sweep
down on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t bother you,&#8221; said Menard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not, but we must be careful. For
my part, I look for trouble. The nations stand
pretty closely by each other, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t bother you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I come down here for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t tell me. Oh, you had a mission
to the other nations? But that can&#8217;t be,&ndash;&ndash;you
were captured.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard lay on his side, and watched the
flames go roaring upward as the soldiers piled
up the logs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could tell you some things, Du Peron,&#8221;
he said slowly. &#8220;I suppose you didn&#8217;t know,&ndash;&ndash;for
that matter you couldn&#8217;t know,&ndash;&ndash;but when
the column was marching on the Senecas, and
our rear-guard of four hundred men&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four hundred and forty.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The same thing. You can&#8217;t expect the
Cayugas to count so sharply as that. At that
time the Cayugas and Onondagas held a council
to discuss the question of sending a thousand
warriors to cut off the rear-guard and the
Governor&#8217;s communications.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant slowly whistled.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did they know so much about it,
Menard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could they help it? Our good Governor
had posted his plans on every tree. You
can see what would have happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, with the Senecas on his front it
would have been&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He paused, and whistled
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&ndash;&ndash;you see. But they didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I spoke at that council.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You spoke&ndash;&ndash;but you were a prisoner,
weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant sat staring into the fire.
Slowly it came to him what it was that the
Captain had accomplished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Menard,&#8221; he said, &#8220;New France
won&#8217;t be able to hold you, when this gets out.
How you must have gone at them. You&#8217;ll be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
a major in a week. You&#8217;re the luckiest man
this side of Versailles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. And I won&#8217;t be a major.
I&#8217;m not on the Governor&#8217;s pocket list. But I
don&#8217;t care about that. That isn&#8217;t the reason I
did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you do it then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;That&#8217;s the question I&#8217;ve been asking
myself for several days, Du Peron.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant was too thoroughly aroused
to note the change in the Captain&#8217;s tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t see it right now, Menard. Wait
till you&#8217;ve reached the city, and got into some
clothes and a good bed, and can shake hands
with d&#8217;Orvilliers and Provost and the general
staff,&ndash;&ndash;maybe with the Governor himself.
Then you&#8217;ll feel different. You&#8217;re down now.
I know how it feels. You&#8217;re all tired out, and
you&#8217;ve got the Onondaga dirt rubbed on so
thick that you&#8217;re lost in it. You wait a few
weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the Governor have much trouble with
the Senecas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he had to fight for it. He was&ndash;&ndash;My
God, Menard, what about the girl? I was
so shaken up at meeting you like this that it
got away from me. The column had hardly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
got to the fort on their way up from Montreal
before everyone was asking for you. La
Grange had a letter from her father saying that
she was with you, and he&#8217;s been in a bad way.
He says that he was to have married her, and
that you&#8217;ve got away with her. It serves him
right, the beast. One night, at La Famine, he
was drunk, and he came around to all of us
reading that letter at the top of his voice and
swearing to kill you the moment he sees you.
He&#8217;s been talking a good deal about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is here, asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is La Grange now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s over at Frontenac. He got into trouble
before we left La Famine. He&#8217;s drinking
hard now, you know. He had command of a
company that was working on the stockades,
and he made such a muss of it that his sergeant
had to take hold and handle it to get
the work done at all. You can imagine what
bad feeling that made in his company. Played
the devil with his discipline. Well, he took
it like a child. But that night, when he
got a little loose on his legs, he hunted up the
sergeant and made him fight. The fellow
wouldn&#8217;t until La Grange came at him with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
his sword, but then he cracked his head with
a musket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. They took him up to Frontenac.
He&#8217;s in the hospital now, but it&#8217;s pretty generally
understood that d&#8217;Orvilliers won&#8217;t let
him go out until the Governor gets back from
Niagara. He&#8217;s well enough already, they say.
It&#8217;s hard on the sergeant, too; no one blames
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Peron looked around and saw Teganouan
lying near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s this Indian?&#8221; he asked in a low
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is with me. A mission Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he know French? Has he understood
us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I suppose so. Here is
Father Claude de Casson. You remember
him, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant rose to greet the priest, and
then the three sat together.</p>
<p>&#8220;You asked me about the fight, didn&#8217;t you,
Menard? I don&#8217;t seem able to hold to a subject
very long to-night. We struck out from
La Famine on the morning of the twelfth of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
July. You know the trail that leads south
from La Famine? We followed that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard smiled at the leaping fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh, Menard; that was no worse
than what we&#8217;ve done from the start. The
Governor never thought but what we&#8217;d surprise
them as much on that road as on another.
And after all, we won, though it did look bad
for a while. There was a time, at the beginning
of the fight,&ndash;&ndash;well, I&#8217;m getting ahead of
myself again. We were in fairly good order.
Calli&egrave;res had the advance with the Montreal
troops. He threw out La Durantaye, with
Tonty and Du Luth,&ndash;&ndash;the <i>coureurs de bois</i>,
you know,&ndash;&ndash;to feel the way. La Durantaye
had the mission Indians, from Sault St. Louis
and the Montreal Mountain, on his left, and
the Ottawas and Mackinac tribes on his right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did the Ottawas behave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wretchedly. They ran at the first fire. I&#8217;ll
come to that. The others weren&#8217;t so bad, but
there was no holding them. They spread
through the forest, away out of reach. Perrot
had the command, but he could only follow
after and knock one down now and then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Governor took command of the main
force?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And he carried his bale like the
worst of us; I&#8217;ll say that for him. It was hot,
and we all drooped a bit before night. And
he made a good fight, too, if you can forgive
him that bungling march. When we bivouacked,
some of Du Luth&#8217;s boys scouted ahead.
They got in by sunrise. They&#8217;d been to the
main village of the Senecas on the hill beyond
the marsh,&ndash;&ndash;you know it, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they saw nothing but a few women
and a pack of dogs. The Governor was up
early,&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s not used to sleeping out doors in
the mosquito country,&ndash;&ndash;sitting on a log at the
side of the trail, talking with Granville and
Berthier. I wasn&#8217;t five yards behind them,
trying to scrape the mud off my boots&ndash;&ndash;you
know how that mud sticks, Menard. Well,
when the scouts came in with their story, the
Governor stood up. &#8216;Take my order to La
Durantaye,&#8217; he said, &#8216;that he is to move on
with all caution, that the surprise may be complete.
He will push forward, following the
trail. You,&#8217; he said, to a few aides who stood
by, &#8216;will see that the command is aroused as
silently as possible.&#8217; Well, I didn&#8217;t know
whether to laugh at the Governor or pity myself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
and the boys. Any man but the crowd
of seigniors that he had about him would have
foreseen what was coming. I knew that the
devils were waiting for us, probably at one of
the ravines where the trail runs through that
group of hills just this side of the marsh. You
know the place,&ndash;&ndash;every one of us knows it.
But what could we say? I&#8217;d have given a
month&#8217;s pay to have been within ear-shot of La
Durantaye when he got the order. La Valterie
told me about it afterward. &#8216;What&#8217;s this?&#8217; he
says, &#8216;follow the trail? I&#8217;ll go to the devil first.
There&#8217;s a better place for my bones than this
pest-ridden country.&#8217; He calls to Du Luth:
&#8216;Hear this, Du Luth. We&#8217;re to &#8220;push forward,
following the trail.&#8221;&#8217; I can fairly hear
him say it, with his eyes looking right through
the young aide. &#8216;Not I,&#8217; says Du Luth, &#8216;I&#8217;m
going around the hills and come into the village
over the long oak ridge!&#8217; &#8216;You can&#8217;t do
it. I have the Governor&#8217;s order.&#8217; And then
Du Luth drew himself up, La Valterie says,
and looked the aide (who wasn&#8217;t used to this
kind of a soldier, and wished himself back
under the Governor&#8217;s petticoats) up and down
till the fellow got red as a Lower Town girl.
&#8216;Tell your commanding officer,&#8217; says Du Luth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
in his big voice, &#8216;that the advance will &#8220;push
forward, following the trail,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and may God
have mercy on our poor souls!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Menard, they did it, nine hundred
of them. And we came on, a quarter of a
league after, with sixteen hundred more. We
got into the first defile, and through it, with
never a sound. Then I was sure of trouble
in the second, but long after the advance had
had time to get through, everything was still.
There was still the third defile, just before you
reach the marsh, and my head was spinning,
waiting for the first shot and wondering where
we were to catch it and how many of us were
to get out alive. And then, all at once it
came. You see the Senecas, three hundred
of them at least, were in the brush up on the
right slope of the third defile; and as many
more were in the elder thickets and swamp
grass ahead and to the left. They let the
whole advance get through,&ndash;&ndash;fooled every
man of Du Luth&#8217;s scouts,&ndash;&ndash;and then came
at them from all sides. We heard the noise&ndash;&ndash;I
never heard a worse&ndash;&ndash;and started up on
the run; and then there was the strangest
mess I ever got into. They had surprised the
advance, right enough,&ndash;&ndash;we could see Du
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
Luth and Tonty running about knocking men
down and bellowing out orders to hold their
force together,&ndash;&ndash;but you see the Senecas
never dreamed that a larger force was coming
on behind, and we struck them like a whirlwind.
Well, for nearly an hour we didn&#8217;t
know what was going on. Our Indians and
the Senecas were so mixed together that we
dared not shoot to kill. Our own boys, even
the regulars, lost their heads and fell into the
tangle. It was all yelling and whooping and
banging and running around, with the smoke so
thick that you couldn&#8217;t find the trail or the hills
or the swamp. I was crowded up to my arms
in water and mud for the last part of the time.
Once the smoke lifted a little, and I saw what
I thought to be a mission Indian, not five
yards away, in the same fix. I called to him
to help me, and he turned out to be a Seneca
chief. Our muskets were wet,&ndash;&ndash;at least mine
was, and I saw that he dropped his when he
started for me,&ndash;&ndash;so we had it out with
knives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he get at you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once. A rib stopped it&ndash;&ndash;no harm done.
Well, I was tired, but I got out and dodged
around through the smoke to find out where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
our boys were, but they were mixed up worse
than ever. I was just in time to save a <i>coureur</i>
from killing one of our Indians with his own
hatchet. Most of the regulars scattered as
soon as they lost sight of their officers. And
Berthier,&ndash;&ndash;I found him lying under a log all
gone to pieces with fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how it was to come out
until at last the firing eased a little, and the
smoke thinned out. Then we found that the
devils had slipped away, all but a few who had
wandered so far into our lines&ndash;&ndash;if you could
call them lines&ndash;&ndash;that they couldn&#8217;t get out.
They carried most of their killed, though we
picked up a few on the edge of the marsh.
It took all the rest of the day to pull things
together and find out how we stood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavy loss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t know how many, but beyond
a hundred or so of cuts and flesh-wounds like
mine we seemed to have a full force. We
went on in the morning, after a puffed-out
speech by the Governor, and before night
reached the village. The Senecas had already
burned a part of it, but we finished it, and
spent close to ten days cutting their corn and
destroying the fort on the big hill, a league
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
or more to the east. Then we came back to
La Famine, and the Governor took the whole
column to Niagara,&ndash;&ndash;to complete the parade,
I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>The story told, they sat by the fire, silent
at first, then talking as the mood prompted,
until the flames had died and the red embers
were fading to gray. Father Claude had
stretched out and was sleeping.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must look about my camp,&#8221; Du Peron
said at length. &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; said Menard; and alone he
sat there until the last spark had left the scattered
heap of charred wood.</p>
<p>The night was cold and clear. The lake
stretched out to a misty somewhere, touching
the edge of the sky. He rose and walked
toward the water. A figure, muffled in a
blanket stood on the dark, firm sand close to
the breaking ripples. He thought it was one
of Du Peron&#8217;s sentries, but a doubt drew
him nearer. Then the blanket was thrown
aside, and he recognized, in the moonlight, the
slender figure of the maid. She was gazing
out toward the pole-star and the dim clouds
that lay motionless beneath it. The splash of
the lake and the call of the locusts and tree-toads
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
on the bank behind them were the only
sounds. He went slowly forward and stood
by her side. She looked up into his eyes,
then turned to the lake. She had dropped
the blanket to the sand, and he placed it again
about her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not cold,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid, Mademoiselle. The air is chill.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood for a long time without speaking,
while the northern clouds sank slowly beneath
the horizon, their tops gleaming white in the
moonlight. Once a sharp command rang
through the night, and muskets rattled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; she whispered, touching his
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are changing the guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not need to watch to-night,
M&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; not again. We shall have an escort to
Frontenac.&#8221; He paused; then added in uncertain
voice, &#8220;but perhaps&ndash;&ndash;if Mademoiselle&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him. He went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will watch to-night, and to-morrow night,
and once again&ndash;&ndash;then there will be no need:
we shall be at Frontenac. Yes, I will watch; I
will myself keep guard, that Mademoiselle may
sleep safely and deep, as she slept at the Long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
Lake and in the forests of the Cayugas. And
perhaps, while she is sleeping, and the lake lies
still, I may dream again as I did then&ndash;&ndash;I will
carry on our story to the end, and then&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He could not say more; he could not look at
her. Even at the rustle of her skirt, as she
sank to the beach and sat gazing up at him, he
did not turn. He was looking dully at the last
bright cloud tip, sinking slowly from his sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frontenac lies there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I told them
I should bring you there. It has been a longer
road than we thought,&ndash;&ndash;it has been a harder
road,&ndash;&ndash;and they have said that I broke my
trust. Perhaps they were not wrong&ndash;&ndash;I would
have broken it&ndash;&ndash;once. But we shall be there
in three days. I will keep my promise to the
chiefs; and we&ndash;&ndash;we shall not meet again. It
will be better. But I shall keep watch, to-night
and twice again. That will be all.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down, and at sight of the mute
figure his face softened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me&ndash;&ndash;I should not have spoken.
It has been a mad dream&ndash;&ndash;the waking is hard.
When I saw you standing here to-night, I knew
that I had no right to come&ndash;&ndash;and still I came.
I have called myself a soldier&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;his voice
was weary&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;see, this is what is done to soldiers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
such as I.&#8221; One frayed strip of an epaulet
yet hung from his shoulder. He tore it
off and threw it out into the lake. A little
splash, and it was gone. &#8220;Good-night, Mademoiselle,&ndash;&ndash;good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away. The maid leaned forward
and called. Her voice would not come. She
called again and again. Then he heard, for he
stood motionless.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu!&#8221;</p>
<p>He came back slowly, and stood waiting.
She was leaning back on her hands. Her hair
had fallen over her face, and she shook it back,
gazing up and trying to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said&ndash;&ndash;you said, the end&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated, as if he dared not meet his
thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said&ndash;&ndash;See,&#8221; she fumbled hastily at
her bosom, &#8220;see, I have kept it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was holding something up to him. In
the dim light he could not make it out. He
took it and held it up. It was the dried stem
and the crumbling blossom of a daisy. For a moment
he kept it there, then, while he looked, he
reached into his pocket and drew out the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;yes&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; His voice trembled;
his hand shook. Her hair had fallen again, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
she was trying to fasten it back. He looked at
her, almost fiercely, but now her eyes were hidden.
&#8220;We will go to Frontenac;&#8221; he said; &#8220;we
will go to Frontenac, you and I. But they
shall not get you.&#8221; He caught the hands that
were braiding her hair, and held them in his
rough grip. &#8220;It is too late. Let them break my
sword, if they will, still they shall not get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her head dropped upon his hands, and for
the second time since those days at Onondaga,
he felt her tears. For a moment they were
motionless; he erect, looking out to the pole-star
and over the water that stretched far away to
the stone fort, she sobbing and clinging to his
scarred hands. Then a desperate look came
into his eyes, and he dropped on one knee and
caught her shoulders and held her tightly, close
against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; he said, with the old mad ring in his
voice, &#8220;see what a soldier I am! See how I keep
my trust! But now&ndash;&ndash;but now it is too late
for them all. I am still a soldier, and I can
fight, Valerie. And God will be good to us.
God grant that we are doing right. There is
no other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she whispered after him; &#8220;there is no
other way.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>FRONTENAC.</h3>
</div>
<p>The sun was dropping behind the western
forests. From the lodges and cabins of
the friendly Indians about the fort rose a hundred
thin columns of smoke. Long rows of
bateaux and canoes lined the beach below the
log palisade; and others drew near the shore,
laden with fish. There was a stir and bustle
about the square within the stone bastions;
orderlies hurried from quarters to barracks,
bugles sounded, and groups of ragged soldiers
sat about, polishing muskets and belts, and
setting new flints. Men of the commissary
department were carrying boxes and bales from
the fort to a cleared space on the beach.</p>
<p>Menard walked across the square and
knocked at the door of Major d&#8217;Orvilliers&#8217;s
little house. Many an eye had followed him
as he hurried by, aroused to curiosity by his
tattered uniform, rusted musket, and boot-tops
rudely stitched to deerskin moccasins.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Major d&#8217;Orvilliers is busy,&#8221; said the orderly
at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him it is Captain Menard.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment the Major himself appeared in
the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Menard. I am to start in an
hour or so to meet Governor Denonville, but
there is always time for you. I&#8217;ll start a little
late, if necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Governor comes from Niagara?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He is two or three days&#8217; journey up
the lake. I am to escort him back.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the office in the rear of
the house, and the Major brushed a heap of
documents and drawings from a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Menard. You have a long story,
I take it. You look as if you&#8217;d been to the
Illinois and back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew of my capture?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We had about given you up. And
the girl,&ndash;&ndash;Mademoiselle St. Denis&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&ndash;&ndash;at Frontenac?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; in Father de Casson&#8217;s care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God! But how did you do it?
How did you get her here, and yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard rose and paced up and down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
room. As he walked, he told the story of the
capture at La Gallette, of the days in the Onondaga
village, of the council and the escape.
When he had finished, there was a long silence,
while the Major sat with contracted brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done a big thing, Menard,&#8221; he said
at last, &#8220;one of the biggest things that has
been done in New France. But have you
thought of the Governor&ndash;&ndash;of how he will
take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not be easy. Denonville doesn&#8217;t
know the Iroquois as you and I do. He is
elated now about his victory,&ndash;&ndash;he thinks he
has settled the question of white supremacy.
If I were to tell him to-morrow that he has
only made a bitter enemy of the Senecas, and
that they will not rest until they wipe out this
defeat, do you suppose he would believe it?
You have given a pledge to the Iroquois that
is entirely outside of the Governor&#8217;s view of
military precedent. To tell the truth, Menard,
I don&#8217;t believe he will like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know the strength of the Five
Nations. He thinks they would all flee before
our regulars just as the Senecas did. Worse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
than that, he doesn&#8217;t know the Indian temperament.
I&#8217;m afraid you can&#8217;t make him understand
that to satisfy their hunger for revenge
will serve better than a score of orations and
treaties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think he won&#8217;t touch La Grange?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am almost certain of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it rests with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave another pledge, d&#8217;Orvilliers. If the
Governor won&#8217;t do this&ndash;&ndash;I shall have to do it
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Save for a moment&#8217;s hesitation Menard&#8217;s
voice was cool and even; but he had stopped
walking and was looking closely at the commandant.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Orvilliers was gazing at the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; he said
slowly, and then suddenly he got up. &#8220;My
God, Menard, you don&#8217;t mean that you
would&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That can&#8217;t be! I can&#8217;t allow it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not be necessary. I hope you are
mistaken about the Governor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I am&ndash;&ndash;but no; he won&#8217;t help you.
He&#8217;s not in the mood for paying debts to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
weakened enemy. And&ndash;&ndash;Menard, sit down.
I must talk plainly to you. I can&#8217;t go on
covering things up now. I don&#8217;t believe you
see the matter clearly. If it were a plain question
of your mission to the Onondagas&ndash;&ndash;if it
were&ndash;&ndash;Well, I want you to tell me in what
relation you stand to Mademoiselle St. Denis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Captain was standing by the chair. He
rested his arms on the high back, and looked
over them at d&#8217;Orvilliers.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is to be my wife,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Orvilliers leaned back and slowly shook
his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when your story
goes to Quebec, when the Ch&acirc;teau learns that
you have promised the punishment of La
Grange in the name of France, and then of
this,&ndash;&ndash;of Mademoiselle and her relations to
yourself and to La Grange,&ndash;&ndash;do you know
what they will do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will laugh&ndash;&ndash;first, and then&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;I have thought
of all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have told all this in your report?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you would go on with it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I am going on with it. There is
nothing else I can do. I couldn&#8217;t have offered
to give myself up; they already had me. The
fault was La Grange&#8217;s. What I did was the
only thing that could have been done to save
the column; if you will think it over, you will
see that. I know what I did,&ndash;&ndash;I know I was
right; and if my superiors, when I have given
my report, choose to see it in another way, I
have nothing to say. If they give me my
liberty, in the army or out of it, I will find La
Grange. If not, I will wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not give that up, at least, Menard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I give that up, we shall have a war with
the Iroquois that will shake New France as she
has never been shaken before.&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Orvilliers started to speak, but checked the
words. Menard slung his musket behind his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Menard. I don&#8217;t know what to say.
I must have time to think. If you wish, I will
not give notice of your arrival to the Governor.
I will leave the matter of reporting in your
hands.&#8221; He rose, and fingered the papers on
the table. &#8220;You see how it will look&ndash;&ndash;there
is the maid&ndash;&ndash;La Grange seeks your life, you
seek his&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span></p>
<p>Menard drew himself up, his hat in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall be pushed to the end, Major. You
know me; you know Captain la Grange.
There will be excitement, perhaps,&ndash;&ndash;you may
find it hard to avoid taking one side or the
other. I must ask which side is to be yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Orvilliers winced, and for a moment stood
biting his lip; then he stepped forward and
took both Menard&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have asked that,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;God bless you, Menard! God bless you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard paused in the door, and turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I need a pass to enter the hospital?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t go there. La Grange is
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I will report to him. He shall not say
that I have left it to hearsay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he will attack you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I will not fight him until I have an
answer from the Governor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get in now until morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be careful, Menard?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Captain nodded and left the room.
Wishing to settle his thoughts, he passed
through the palisade gate and walked down
the beach. The commissary men were loading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
the canoes, threescore of them, that were
to carry the garrison on its westward journey.
Already the twilight was deepening, and the
lanterns of the officers were dimmed by the
glow from a hundred Indian camp-fires.</p>
<p>From within the fort came a long bugle-call.
There was a distant rattling of arms and shouting
of commands, then the tramp of feet, and
the indistinct line came swinging through the
sally-port. They halted at the water&#8217;s edge,
broke ranks, and took to the canoes, paddling
easily away along the shore until they had
faded into shadows. A score of Indians stood
watching them, stolidly smoking stone pipes
and holding their blankets close around them.</p>
<p>It was an hour later when the Captain returned
to the fort and started across the enclosure
toward the hut which had been assigned to
him. Save for a few Indians and a sentry who
paced before the barracks, the fort seemed
deserted. It was nearly dark now, and the
lanterns at the sally-port and in front of barrack
and hospital glimmered faintly. Menard
had reached his own door, when he heard a
voice calling, and turned. A dim figure was
running across the square toward the sentry.
There was a moment of breathless talk,&ndash;&ndash;Menard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
could not catch the words,&ndash;&ndash;then the
sentry shouted. It occurred to Menard that
he was now the senior officer at the fort, and
he waited. A corporal led up his guard, halted,
and again there was hurried talking. Menard
started back toward them, but before he reached
the spot all were running toward the hospital,
and a dozen others of the home guard had
gathered before the barracks and were talking
and asking excited questions.</p>
<p>Menard crossed to the hospital. Two privates
barred the door, and he was forced to
wait until a young Lieutenant of the regulars
appeared. The lanterns over the door threw a
dim light on the Captain as he stood on the
low step.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the Lieutenant. &#8220;You
wished to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Captain Menard. What is the trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant looked doubtfully at the
dingy, bearded figure, then he motioned the
soldiers aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Captain la Grange,&#8221; he said, when
Menard had entered; &#8220;he has been killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant spoke in a matter-of-fact
tone, but his eyes were shining and he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
breathing rapidly. Menard looked at him for
a moment without a word, then he stepped to
the door of a back room and looked in. Three
flickering candles stood on a low table, and
another on a chair at the head of the narrow
bed. The light wavered over the log and plaster
walls. A surgeon was bending over the bed,
his assistant waiting at his elbow with instruments;
the two shut off the upper part of the
bed from Menard&#8217;s view. The Lieutenant
stood behind the Captain, looking over his
shoulder; both were motionless. There was
no sound save a low word at intervals between
the two surgeons, and the creak of a bore-worm
that sounded distinctly from a log in the
wall.</p>
<p>Menard turned away and walked back to the
outer door, the Lieutenant with him. There
they stood, silent, as men are who have been
brought suddenly face to face with death. At
last the Lieutenant began to speak in a subdued
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We only know that it was an Indian. He
has been scalped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; muttered Menard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he is still breathing,&ndash;&ndash;he was just
before you came,&ndash;&ndash;but there is no hope for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
him. He was stabbed in a dozen places. It
was some time before we knew&ndash;&ndash;the Indian
came in by the window, and must have found
him asleep. There was no struggle.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood again without speaking, and
again the Lieutenant broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad. He was a good fellow.&#8221; He
paused, as if searching for a kind word for Captain
la Grange. &#8220;He was the best shot at the
fort when he&ndash;&ndash;when&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Menard. He too wished to speak
no harsh word. &#8220;Is there anything I can do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. There is a strong guard about
the fort, but I think the Indian had escaped
before we learned of it. I will see you before
we take further steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I shall be at my quarters.
Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard walked slowly back across the enclosure.
At the door of his hut he paused,
and for a long time he stood there, looking up
at the quiet sky. His mind was scattered for
the moment; he could not think clearly.</p>
<p>He opened his door and stepped over the log
threshold, letting the door close after him of its
own weight. The hut was dark, with but a square
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
of dim light at the window. He fumbled for
the candle and struck a light.</p>
<p>There was a low rustle from the corner.
Menard whirled around and peered into the
shadows. The candle was blowing; he caught
it up and shielded it with his hand. A figure
was crouching in the corner, half hidden behind
a cloak that hung there. The Captain
sprang forward holding the candle high, tore
down the cloak, and discovered Teganouan, the
Onondaga, bending over feeling for his hatchet
which lay on the floor at his feet. Menard
caught his shoulders, and dragging him out of
reach of the hatchet, threw him full length on
the floor. The candle dropped and rolled on
the floor, but before it could go out, Menard
snatched it up.</p>
<p>Slowly Teganouan rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan comes in a strange manner to
the lodge of the white warrior,&#8221; said Menard,
scornfully. &#8220;He steals in like a Huron thief,
and hides in dark corners.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian looked at him defiantly, but did
not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Onondaga brother does not wish to
show himself in the light. Perhaps there is
some trouble on his mind. Perhaps he is governed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
by an evil Oki who loves the darkness.&#8221;
While Menard was speaking he was moving
quietly toward the door. The Indian saw, but
beyond turning slowly so as always to face his
captor, made no movement. His face, except
for the blazing eyes, was inscrutable. In a moment
Menard stood between him and the door.
&#8220;Perhaps it is best that I should call for the
warriors of the fort. They will be glad to find
here the slayer of their brother.&#8221; His hand was
on the latch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo will not call to his brothers.&#8221;
The Indian&#8217;s voice was calm. Menard
looked closely at him. &#8220;He has not thought
yet. When he has thought, he will understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan speaks like a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Teganouan is a child, can the Big Buffalo
tell why he came to the white man&#8217;s
lodge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he has slain a great white warrior,
he must hide his face like the outcast dog.&#8221;
Menard pointed to the scalp that hung at his
waist. &#8220;He has slain a great warrior while the
hatchet lies buried in the ground. He has
broken the law of the white man and the redman.
And so he must hide his face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did not Teganouan run to the woods?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
Why did he come to the lodge of the Big Buffalo?&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard looked steadily at him. He began
to understand. The shrewd old warrior had
chosen the one hiding-place where no searching
party would look. Perhaps he had hoped for
aid from the Captain, remembering his pledge
to bring punishment on La Grange. If so, he
should learn his mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan&#8217;s words are idle.&#8221; Menard
moved the latch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Buffalo will not open the door.
Teganouan has not delivered his message. He
is not an enemy to the Big Buffalo. He is
his friend. He has come to this lodge, caring
nothing for the safety of his life, that he might
give his message. The Big Buffalo will not
open the door. He will wait to hear the
words of Teganouan; and then he may call
to his brother warriors if he still thinks it
would be wise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak quickly, Teganouan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan&#8217;s words are like the wind. He
has brought them many leagues,&ndash;&ndash;from the
lodges of the Onondagas,&ndash;&ndash;that he may speak
them now. He has brought them from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
Long House of the Five Nations, where the
fires burn brightly by day and by night, where
the greatest chiefs of many thousand warriors
are met to hear the Voice of the Great Mountain,
the father of white men and redmen.
The Great Mountain has a strong voice. It
is louder than cannon; it wounds deeper than
the musket of the white brave. It tells the
Onondagas and Cayugas and Oneidas and
Mohawks that they must not give aid to their
brothers, the Senecas, who have fallen, whose
corn and forts and lodges are burned to ashes
and scattered on the winds. It tells the Onondagas
that the Great Mountain is a kind
father, that he loves them like his own children,
and will punish the man who wrongs
them, let him be white or red. It tells the
Onondagas that the white captain, who has
robbed a hundred Onondaga lodges of their
bravest hunters, shall be struck by the strong
arm of the Great Mountain, shall be blown to
pieces by the Voice that thunders from the
great water where the seal are found to the
farthest village of the Five Nations. And
the chiefs hear the Voice; they listen with
ears that are always open to the counsel of
Onontio. They take his promises into their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
hearts and believe them. They know that he
will strike down the dog of a white captain.
They refuse aid to their dying brothers, the
Senecas, because they know that the strong
arm of Onontio is over them, that it will give
them peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, gazing with bright eyes at Menard.
There was no reply, and he continued:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Great Mountain has kept his word.
The Onondagas shall know, in their council,
that Onontio&#8217;s promise has been kept, that
the white brave, who lied to their hunters and
sent them in chains across the big water, has
gone to a hunting-ground where his musket
will not help him, where the buffalo shall
trample him and tear his flesh with their
horns. Then the Onondagas shall know that
the Big Buffalo spoke the truth to the Long
House. And this word shall be carried to the
Onondagas by Teganouan. He will go to the
council with the scalp in his hand telling them
that the white children of Onontio are their
brothers. Teganouan sees the Big Buffalo
stand with his strong hand at the door. He
knows that the Big Buffalo could call his warriors
to seize Teganouan, and bind him, and
bid him stand before the white men&#8217;s muskets.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
But Teganouan is not a child. He sees with
the eye of the old warrior who has fought a
battle for every sun in the year, who has
known the white man as well as the redman.
When the Big Buffalo stood in the Long
House, Teganouan believed him; Teganouan
knew that his words were true. And now the
heart of Teganouan is warm with trust. He
knows that the Big Buffalo is a wise warrior
and that he has an honest heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause, and Menard, his hand
still on the latch, stood motionless. He knew
what the Indian meant. He had done no
more than Menard himself had promised the
council, in the name of Governor Denonville,
should be done. The lodges of the allies near
the fort sheltered many an Iroquois spy;
whatever might follow would be known in
every Iroquois village before the week had
passed. To hold Teganouan for trial would
mean war.</p>
<p>There was the tramp of feet on the beaten
ground without, and a clear voice said:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, I must report to Captain
Menard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menard raised the latch an inch, then looked
sharply at Teganouan. The Indian stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
quietly, leaning a little forward, waiting for
the decision. The Captain was on the point
of speaking, but no word came from his parted
lips. The voices were now just outside the
door. With a long breath Menard&#8217;s fingers
relaxed, and the latch slipped back into
place. Then he motioned toward the wall
ladder that reached up into the darkness of
the loft.</p>
<p>Teganouan turned, picked up the hatchet
and thrust it into his belt, took one quick
glance about the room to make sure that no
telltale article remained, and slipped up the
ladder. There was a loud knock on the
door, and Menard opened it. The Lieutenant
came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no word yet, Captain,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Every building in the fort has been searched.
I have so few men that I could not divide them
until this was done, but I am just now sending
out searching parties through the Indian village
and the forest. None of the canoes are
missing. Have I your approval?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you have been here since you left
the hospital?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think, then, that he must have had time to
slip out before we knew of it. There are many
Indians here who would help him; but a few
of them can be trusted, I think, to join the
search. Major d&#8217;Orvilliers left me with only
a handful of men. It will be difficult to accomplish
much until he returns. I will post a
sentry at the sally-port; we shall have to leave
the bastions without a guard. I think it will be
safe, for the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Lieutenant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant saluted and hurried away.
Menard closed the door, and turned to the
table, where were scattered the sheets on
which he had been writing his report. He
collected them and read the report carefully.
He removed one leaf, and rolling it up, lighted
it at the candle, and held it until it was burned
to a cinder. Then he read the other sheets
again. The report now told of his capture, of
a part of the council at the Long House, and
of the escape; but no word was there concerning
Captain la Grange. Another hand had
disposed of that question. Menard sighed as
he laid it down, but soon the lines on his face
relaxed. It was not the first time in the history
of New France that a report had told but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
half the truth; and, after all, the column had
been saved.</p>
<p>He sharpened a quill with his sheath-knife,
and began to copy the report, making further
corrections here and there. Something more
than an hour had passed before the work was
finished. He rolled up the document and tied
it with a thong of deerskin.</p>
<p>It was still early in the evening, but the
fort was as silent as at midnight. Menard
opened the door and walked out a little way.
The lamps were all burning, but no soldiers
were to be seen. The barrack windows were
dark. He stepped back into the house, closed
the door, and said in a low voice:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a stir in the loft. In a moment
the Indian came down the ladder and stood
waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan, you heard what the Lieutenant
said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teganouan has ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I am going to blow out the
candle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The room was dark. The door creaked
softly, and a breath of air blew in upon the
Captain as he stood by the table. He felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
over the table for his tinder-box and struck a
light. The door was slowly closing; Teganouan
had gone.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Another sun was setting. A single drum
was beating loudly as the little garrison drew
up outside the sally-port and presented arms.
The allies and the mission Indians were crowding
down upon the beach, silent, inquisitive,&ndash;&ndash;puffing
at their short pipes. For half a league,
from the flat, white beach out over the rose-tinted
water stretched an irregular black line of
canoes and bateaux, all bristling with muskets.
The Governor had come. He could be seen
kneeling, all sunburned and ragged but with
erect head, in the first canoe. His canoemen
checked their swing, for the beach was close
at hand, and then backed water. The bow
scraped, and a dozen hands were outstretched
in aid, but Governor Denonville stepped briskly
out into the ankle-deep water and carried his
own pack ashore. A cheer went up from the
little line at the sally-port. Du Luth&#8217;s <i>voyageurs</i>
and <i>coureur de bois</i> caught it up, and
then it swept far out over the water and was
echoed back from the forest.</p>
<p>In the doorway of a hut near the Recollet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
Chapel stood Menard and Val&eacute;rie. They
watched canoe after canoe glide up and
empty its load of soldiers, not speaking as
they watched, but thinking each the same
thought. At last, when the straggling line
was pouring into the fort, and the bugles were
screaming, and the drum rolling, Val&eacute;rie slipped
her hand through the Captain&#8217;s arm and
looked up into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was you who brought them here,&#8221; she
said; and then, after a pause, she laughed a
breathless little laugh. &#8220;It was you,&#8221; she
repeated.</p>
